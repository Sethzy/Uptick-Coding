It uses sensors, detectors, and a control panel to trigger audible and visual alarms, providing critical time to evacuate and respond to emergencies.\n### ​\n### Do I need a fire alarm system in my home or business?\nYes. Fire alarms are essential for safety and are often required by local fire codes for both residential and commercial properties. They provide early warnings, which can save lives and prevent significant property damage.\n### What types of fire alarm systems are available?\n  * Conventional Systems: Ideal for smaller buildings, dividing the property into zones to locate potential fires.\n  * Addressable Systems: Perfect for larger properties, offering precise identification of fire locations.\n  * Wireless Systems: Suitable for buildings where hardwiring is impractical.\n  * Combination Systems: Combine fire detection with smoke and carbon monoxide alarms for comprehensive safety.\n\n\n### How often should fire alarms be tested?\nFire alarms should be tested monthly for basic functionality. Annual inspections by certified technicians ensure all components are working properly and meet fire safety standards.\n### What does a fire alarm inspection include?\nAn inspection typically involves:\n  * Testing all detectors, sensors, and alarm devices.\n  * Checking battery life and backup power sources.\n  * Verifying the control panel and wiring connections.\n  * Ensuring compliance with current fire safety regulations.\n\n\n### How do I know if my fire alarm system needs an upgrade?\nYour system might need upgrading if it’s over 10–15 years old, frequently malfunctions, or doesn’t meet updated fire codes. A modern system ensures optimal performance and compliance.\n### Why is my fire alarm beeping or chirping?\nCommon reasons include:\n  * Low Battery: Replace the battery.\n  * Sensor Malfunction: Consult a professional to repair or replace.\n  * End-of-Life Alarm: Alarms typically last 8–10 years.\n\n\n### Can I install a fire alarm system myself?\nBasic smoke detectors can be DIY-installed, but comprehensive fire alarm systems require professional installation to ensure proper setup and compliance with safety codes.\n### Do fire alarms require regular maintenance?\nYes. Maintenance includes:\n  * Cleaning detectors to avoid dust buildup.\n  * Replacing batteries as needed.\n  * Annual servicing by a professional technician to ensure reliability.\n\n\n## Fire Alarms and Central Monitoring\n## ​\n### How does central monitoring enhance a fire alarm system?\nCentral monitoring connects your fire alarm system to a 24/7 monitoring center. If an alarm is triggered, the system automatically alerts the monitoring center, which can contact emergency services for a faster response.\n### Do I need a landline for central monitoring?\nNo. Modern systems can use cellular or internet-based connections, providing reliable communication without requiring a landline.\n### What’s the difference between monitored and non-monitored fire alarms?\n  * Monitored Systems: Automatically alert emergency services through a monitoring center.\n  * Non-Monitored Systems: Trigger only audible alarms, requiring someone on-site to take action.\n\n\n### Can I upgrade my existing fire alarm system to include central monitoring?\nYes. Many modern fire alarm systems are compatible with central monitoring. We can assess your current system and recommend upgrades to integrate monitoring seamlessly.\n## Installation and Service FAQs\n### Do you install fire alarm systems?\nYes, we provide professional installation to ensure your property is protected and compliant with local fire codes.\n### How long does it take to install a fire alarm system?\nInstallation time depends on the size and complexity of your property. Smaller systems may take a single day, while larger or multi-zone systems may take several days.\n### Do you provide ongoing support and maintenance?\nYes. We offer regular maintenance services, annual inspections, and 24/7 support for any issues or emergencies.\n### Ready to Protect Your Property?\nWhether you need a new fire alarm system, an upgrade, or central monitoring, our team is here to help.

It works by releasing a substance—such as water, foam, dry powder, or carbon dioxide—that interrupts the fire's chemical reaction, removing heat, oxygen, or fuel.\nHow many fire extinguishers do I need for my home or business?  \nFor homes, it’s recommended to have at least one fire extinguisher per floor, especially near the kitchen, garage, and any high-risk areas.

Professional servicing includes testing, refilling, and verifying the extinguisher’s performance.\nHow do I know if my fire extinguisher needs recharging?  \nLook at the pressure gauge. If the needle is in the “red” zone, it needs recharging. Also, extinguishers that have been partially discharged must be refilled immediately.\nCan I refill or recharge a disposable fire extinguisher?  \nNo, disposable fire extinguishers cannot be recharged. They must be replaced after use or if they are expired.\nHow can I tell if my fire extinguisher has expired?  \nCheck the manufacturer’s date stamped on the label or cylinder.

It works by releasing a substance—such as water, foam, dry powder, or carbon dioxide—that interrupts the fire's chemical reaction, removing heat, oxygen, or fuel.</p>\n\n<p><span>How many fire extinguishers do I need for my home or business?</span><br>\nFor homes, it’s recommended to have at least one fire extinguisher per floor, especially near the kitchen, garage, and any high-risk areas. Businesses should follow local fire codes, which often require fire extinguishers within 75 feet of travel distance in most environments.</p>\n\n<p><span>What are the different types of fire extinguishers, and what are they used for?</span></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Class A: For ordinary combustibles like wood, paper, and cloth.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Class B: For flammable liquids like oil, grease, and gasoline.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Class C: For electrical fires involving live equipment.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Class D: For flammable metals like magnesium and titanium.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Class K: For kitchen fires involving cooking oils and fats.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><span>How do I know which fire extinguisher is right for me?</span></p>\n\n<p>The type of extinguisher you need depends on the potential fire hazards in your space. For example, kitchens require a Class K extinguisher, while businesses with electrical equipment may need a Class C. We can help you choose the best option.</p>\n\n<p><span>Where should I place fire extinguishers in my home or business?</span><br>\nPlace fire extinguishers in visible and easily accessible locations near high-risk areas, such as the kitchen, garage, or exit points. Businesses should comply with local fire codes for placement requirements.</p>\n\n<h3><span><span><span>Usage and Maintenance</span></span></span></h3>\n\n<p><span>How do I use a fire extinguisher?</span><br>\nFollow the PASS method:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Pull the pin.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Aim at the base of the fire.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Squeeze the handle.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Sweep side to side.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><span>What should I do if I accidentally discharge my fire extinguisher?</span><br>\nIf the extinguisher is partially discharged, it may need to be recharged. Contact a professional service (like us!) to inspect, clean, and refill the extinguisher.</p>\n\n<p><span>How often should fire extinguishers be inspected or serviced?</span></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Monthly: Perform a visual inspection to check for damage, proper pressure, and accessibility.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Annually: Have a professional inspection to ensure compliance and functionality.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Every 6 Years: Internal maintenance is required for certain types.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><span>What is the difference between a visual inspection and a professional service?</span><br>\nA visual inspection involves checking the pressure gauge, seals, and overall condition. Professional servicing includes testing, refilling, and verifying the extinguisher’s performance.</p>\n\n<p><span>How do I know if my fire extinguisher needs recharging?</span><br>\nLook at the pressure gauge. If the needle is in the “red” zone, it needs recharging. Also, extinguishers that have been partially discharged must be refilled immediately.</p>\n\n<p><span>Can I refill or recharge a disposable fire extinguisher?</span><br>\nNo, disposable fire extinguishers cannot be recharged. They must be replaced after use or if they are expired.</p>\n\n<p><span>How can I tell if my fire extinguisher has expired?</span><br>\nCheck the manufacturer’s date stamped on the label or cylinder. Most fire extinguishers have a lifespan of 5–15 years. If it’s older than this or shows signs of damage, replace it.</p>\n\n<p><span>What is the lifespan of a fire extinguisher?</span><br>\nFire extinguishers typically last 5–15 years, depending on the type and maintenance. Regular inspections can help extend their life.</p>\n\n<h3><span><span><span>Regulations and Compliance</span></span></span></h3>\n\n<h3><span><span><span><span>​</span></span></span></span></h3>\n\n<p><span>What are the fire extinguisher requirements for businesses?</span><br>\nRequirements vary by location and industry, but generally, businesses must:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Have fire extinguishers within 75 feet of travel distance.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Use the correct extinguisher type for specific hazards.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Perform regular inspections and employee training.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><span>Are there laws about having fire extinguishers in vehicles or machinery?</span><br>\nYes, certain industries, like construction and transportation, require fire extinguishers in vehicles and heavy machinery. These must be readily accessible and properly maintained.</p>\n\n<p><span>Do I need a specific type of extinguisher for a commercial kitchen or restaurant?</span><br>\nYes, commercial kitchens require Class K fire extinguishers to combat fires caused by cooking oils and fats.</p>\n\n<h3><span><span><span>Training and Safety</span></span></span></h3>\n\n<p><span>​</span></p>\n\n<p><span>Do I need training to use a fire extinguisher?</span><br>\nWhile training isn’t legally required for homeowners, it’s highly recommended to know how to use one safely. For businesses, training is often required by OSHA and other local regulations.</p>\n\n<p><span><span>​</span></span></p>\n\n<p><span>Can I use a fire extinguisher on any type of fire?</span><br>\nNo, using the wrong extinguisher can make a fire worse. For example, using water on an electrical or grease fire can spread flames. Always ensure you have the right extinguisher for the type of fire.</p>\n\n<p><span>When should I not use a fire extinguisher?</span></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>When the fire is too large or spreading quickly.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you’re not sure which type of extinguisher to use.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If your escape route is blocked.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><span>What should I do if a fire extinguisher doesn’t work during an emergency?</span><br>\nImmediately evacuate the area and call 911. Never attempt to fight a fire with a faulty extinguisher.</p>\n\n<p><span>​</span></p>\n\n<h3><span><span><span>Disposal and Replacement</span></span></span></h3>\n\n<p><span>How do I dispose of an old or empty fire extinguisher?</span><br>\nContact your local waste disposal service or bring it to us. Never throw a fire extinguisher in the trash—it must be properly emptied and recycled.</p>\n\n<p><span>Can fire extinguishers be recycled?</span><br>\nYes, most fire extinguisher components, such as the metal cylinder, can be recycled once properly emptied.</p>\n\n<p><span>When should I replace my fire extinguisher instead of recharging it?</span><br>\nReplace it if:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>It’s damaged or corroded.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It’s expired.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It’s a disposable model.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><span><span><span>Mobile Services</span></span></span></h3>\n\n<h3><span><span><span><span>​</span></span></span></span></h3>\n\n<p><span>Do you offer on-site fire extinguisher inspections and recharging?</span><br>\nYes, our mobile service team can come to your location to inspect, recharge, or replace fire extinguishers.

An air test at 25 PSI is to be conducted prior to flowing the system with water. (NFPA 25 6.3). Pressure over 25 PSI is not recommended due to the the potential for damage should any components of the plumbing fail. (Wet systems do not require this, as any leaks are evident by the presence of water. Note that NFPA 25 does not have an established allowable leakage rate, rather, it is subject to the judgement and experience of the fire protection contractor to determine if leakage should halt further testing until repairs are made.</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.firesolutionsnw.com/newfire/services/standpipe-hydrostatic-testing-5year/\"><span>Standpipe Hydrostatic Testing

work?**\n**Your alarm system has a “dialer” incorporated into the main circuit board, that connects to your phone line and “dials” the central alarm monitoring station (central station) and communicates with the central station computers. The alarm control sends signals to the central station computers which identify the specific location of the alarm system (or the protected premise), the nature of the alarm (burglary, fire, panic, duress…) and the location of the problem (front door, basement motion detector, attic smoke detector…).**\n**What happens at the central station?**\n**After the information has been received from the https://masterpaving.ie (alarm system), the central station computer brings up the information along with the appropriate police, fire and medical departments to the central station operator’s dispatch terminal. The operator also has the instructions for how to handle each individual situation that can occur with the alarm system.**\n**Customized responses could include notifying a guard company, paging the home owner, or only notifying the emergency call list and not the police.**\n**Alarm monitoring with today’s burglar and fire alarm controls gives the central station a great amount of information if you contact Home Concierge concerning the status of the alarm. Customization of response through the central station operator allows the premise owner the greatest ability to control access and security for their property and loved ones.**\n**Please[contact](https://www.firesolutionsnw.com/services/alarm-monitoring-services/<https:/www.firesolutionsnw.com/contact-us/>) a Fire Solutions NW Representative to get a free quote today!**\n", "markdown_fit": "**Your alarm system has a “dialer” incorporated into the main circuit board, that connects to your phone line and “dials” the central alarm monitoring station (central station) and communicates with the central station computers.

Services</h1>\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><strong>How does the alarm work?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Your alarm system has a “dialer” incorporated into the main circuit board, that connects to your phone line and “dials” the central alarm monitoring station (central station) and communicates with the central station computers. The alarm control sends signals to the central station computers which identify the specific location of the alarm system (or the protected premise), the nature of the alarm (burglary, fire, panic, duress…) and the location of the problem (front door, basement motion detector, attic smoke detector…).</strong></p>\n<p><strong>What happens at the central station?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>After the information has been received from the https://masterpaving.ie (alarm system), the central station computer brings up the information along with the appropriate police, fire and medical departments to the central station operator’s dispatch terminal. The operator also has the instructions for how to handle each individual situation that can occur with the alarm system.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Customized responses could include notifying a guard company, paging the home owner, or only notifying the emergency call list and not the police.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Alarm monitoring with today’s burglar and fire alarm controls gives the central station a great amount of information if you contact Home Concierge concerning the status of the alarm. Customization of response through the central station operator allows the premise owner the greatest ability to control access and security for their property and loved ones.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Please <a href=\"https://www.firesolutionsnw.com/contact-us/\">contact</a> a Fire Solutions NW Representative to get a free quote

or Condo Rental Property\nNovember 15, 2019 / [Product Spotlight](https://apfecorp.com/blog/3-fire-protection-products-necessary-for-your-home-or-condo-rental-property/<https:/apfecorp.com/blog/category/product-spotlight/>)\nVideo Player\n<https://apfecorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/3_Fire_Protection_Pr.mp4>\n00:00\n00:00\n00:00\nFires are devastating and dangerous events, whether caused by wildfires or by other indoor causes. Unfortunately, California is a state that has experienced the destruction that these events cause. The frequency of wildfires in the western U.S. has increased by , with California being hit hard in recent years. Seasonal wildfires are a danger to residential properties for a part of the year, while indoor fires can happen at any time of year. \nWhen a fire starts, fire protection products can protect your rental house or condo from damage, or give your tenants the necessary time to make a safe exit from the building. The following fire protection products need to be in your rental unit.\n## **Fire Sprinklers**\nDeath by fire in residences occurs when the building does not have the propr, fire prevention services installed. A sprinkler system can be activated in the event of a fire and potentially put the fire out before it spreads to the rent of the house. Rebuilding a rental property that is damaged by fire is a costly process and can be prevented with the use of [emergency fire sprinklers](https://apfecorp.com/blog/3-fire-protection-products-necessary-for-your-home-or-condo-rental-property/<https:/apfecorp.com/products/fire-sprinklers/>). It is also necessary that regular fire sprinkler monitoring is conducted to prevent fire sprinkler leaks. This is especially important in a multi-family unit that has many people living in it. \n**_Tip:_** If you are planning on building a rental property, California is one of two states that requires all one- and two-family dwellings to have automatic sprinkler systems installed in the event of a fire. \n## **Fire Alarms**\nSmoke detectors and fire alarms in a rental property are required in the state of California. Fire alarms play a big role in keeping your tenants safe in your property, as they reduce the chance of a deadly incident if a fire occurs. As a landlord, you are required to have working fire alarms and carbon monoxide detectors throughout your dwelling to alert tenants of a fire. \n![](https://apfecorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/AdobeStock_181138153.jpg)\nFor example, fire alarms should be installed in all of the property’s bedrooms (or other sleeping areas) and the kitchen. Fire alarm inspections should also be conducted to make sure they are functioning correctly and in UL and NFPA 72 compliance and should be regularly maintained with new batteries. \n## **Fire Extinguishers**\nFire extinguishers are an important part of fire protection products, especially in the rental property’s kitchen and laundry room, where fires can easily occur. An extinguisher can prevent a fire from spreading to the rest of the house if it is used at the onset of the fire. Fire extinguishers should be placed in the right areas around the house, ideally one for each floor of each unit. Fire extinguishers should also be maintained regularly to ensure they are working optimally. \nLuckily, [APFE Fire Protection Services](https://apfecorp.com/blog/3-fire-protection-products-necessary-for-your-home-or-condo-rental-property/<https:/apfecorp.com/>) can provide your rental property in [San Diego and all other California counties](https://apfecorp.com/blog/3-fire-protection-products-necessary-for-your-home-or-condo-rental-property/<https:/apfecorp.com/service-area/>) with fire protection requirements as keeping your tenants and property safe from fire is an important part of a landlord’s job. Minimize the damage that fire does to your property with regular fire alarm maintenance and fire sprinkler maintenance, as well as maintenance and inspections of other fire protection products. \n##  Recent Posts\n[![Commercial building fire](https://apfecorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/4-1-1024x534.png)](https://apfecorp.com/blog/3-fire-protection-products-necessary-for-your-home-or-condo-rental-property/<https:/apfecorp.com/blog/7-tips-for-fire-safety-in-the-workplace/> \"7 Tips for Fire Safety in the Workplace\")\n### [7 Tips for Fire Safety in the Workplace](https://apfecorp.com/blog/3-fire-protection-products-necessary-for-your-home-or-condo-rental-property/<https:/apfecorp.com/blog/7-tips-for-fire-safety-in-the-workplace/> \"7 Tips for Fire Safety in the Workplace\")\n[Read More](https://apfecorp.com/blog/3-fire-protection-products-necessary-for-your-home-or-condo-rental-property/<https:/apfecorp.com/blog/7-tips-for-fire-safety-in-the-workplace/> \"Read More\")\n[![different types of fire extinguishers](https://apfecorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1-1-1024x534.png)](https://apfecorp.com/blog/3-fire-protection-products-necessary-for-your-home-or-condo-rental-property/<https:/apfecorp.com/blog/what-are-the-6-classes-of-fire/> \"What are the 6 Classes of Fire?\")\n### [What are the 6 Classes of Fire?](https://apfecorp.com/blog/3-fire-protection-products-necessary-for-your-home-or-condo-rental-property/<https:/apfecorp.com/blog/what-are-the-6-classes-of-fire/> \"What are the 6 Classes of Fire?\")\n[Read More](https://apfecorp.com/blog/3-fire-protection-products-necessary-for-your-home-or-condo-rental-property/<https:/apfecorp.com/blog/what-are-the-6-classes-of-fire/> \"Read More\")\n[![Fire sprinkler inspection](https://apfecorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/1-1-1024x534.png)](https://apfecorp.com/blog/3-fire-protection-products-necessary-for-your-home-or-condo-rental-property/<https:/apfecorp.com/blog/fire-sprinkler-inspection/> \"What is Included in a Fire Sprinkler Inspection?\")\n### [What is Included in a Fire Sprinkler Inspection?](https://apfecorp.com/blog/3-fire-protection-products-necessary-for-your-home-or-condo-rental-property/<https:/apfecorp.com/blog/fire-sprinkler-inspection/> \"What is Included in a Fire Sprinkler Inspection?\")\n[Read More](https://apfecorp.com/blog/3-fire-protection-products-necessary-for-your-home-or-condo-rental-property/<https:/apfecorp.com/blog/fire-sprinkler-inspection/> \"Read More\")\nNotifications\n### Online Quote Form\n\"*\" indicates required fields\nIs this a Business Quote or a Personal Quote?*\nIs this a Business Quote or a Personal Quote?* Business Personal\nName*\nFirst Name Last Name\nPhone Number*\nEmail Address*\nBusiness Name*\nAddress*\nStreet Address City State Zip Code\nWhich Service Are You Interested In?*\nWhich Service Are You Interested In?

are devastating and dangerous events, whether caused by wildfires or by other indoor causes.   Unfortunately, California is a state that has experienced the destruction that these events cause. The frequency of wildfires in the western U.S. has increased by </span><span>, with California being hit hard in recent years. Seasonal wildfires are a danger to residential properties for a part of the year, while indoor fires can happen at any time of year.  </span></p>\n<p><span>When a fire starts, </span>fire protection products<span> can protect your rental house or condo from damage, or give your tenants the necessary time to make a safe exit from the building. The following fire protection products need to be in your rental unit.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Fire Sprinklers</b></h2>\n<p><span>Death by fire in residences occurs when the building does not have the propr, </span>fire prevention services<span> installed. A sprinkler system can be activated in the event of a fire and potentially put the fire out before it spreads to the rent of the house. Rebuilding a rental property that is damaged by fire is a costly process and can be prevented with the use of <a href=\"https://apfecorp.com/products/fire-sprinklers/\">emergency <span>fire sprinklers</span></a>. It is also necessary that regular fire sprinkler monitoring is conducted to prevent fire sprinkler leaks. This is especially important in a multi-family unit that has many people living in it. </span></p>\n<p><b><i>Tip:</i></b><span> If you are planning on building a rental property, </span><span>California</span><span> is one of two states that requires all one- and two-family dwellings to have automatic sprinkler systems installed in the event of a fire.  </span></p>\n<h2><b>Fire Alarms</b></h2>\n<p><span>Smoke detectors and fire alarms in a rental property are required in the state of California. Fire alarms play a big role in keeping your tenants safe in your property, as they reduce the chance of a deadly incident if a fire occurs. As a landlord, you are required to have working fire alarms and carbon monoxide detectors throughout your dwelling to alert tenants of a fire.  </span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://apfecorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/AdobeStock_181138153.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1120\" height=\"584\"></p>\n<p><span>For example, fire alarms should be installed in all of the property’s bedrooms (or other sleeping areas) and the kitchen. Fire alarm inspections should also be conducted to make sure they are functioning correctly and in UL and NFPA 72 compliance and should be regularly maintained with new batteries.  </span></p>\n<h2><b>Fire Extinguishers</b></h2>\n<p><span>Fire extinguishers are an important part of fire protection products, especially in the rental property’s kitchen and laundry room, where fires can easily occur. An extinguisher can prevent a fire from spreading to the rest of the house if it is used at the onset of the fire. Fire extinguishers should be placed in the right areas around the house, ideally one for each floor of each unit. Fire extinguishers should also be maintained regularly to ensure they are working optimally.   </span></p>\n<p><span>Luckily, </span><a href=\"https://apfecorp.com/\"><span>APFE Fire Protection Services</span></a><span> can provide your rental property in <a href=\"https://apfecorp.com/service-area/\">San Diego and all other California counties</a> with fire protection requirements as keeping your tenants and property safe from fire is an important part of a landlord’s job. Minimize the damage that fire does to your property with regular fire alarm maintenance and fire sprinkler maintenance, as well as maintenance and inspections of other fire protection products.

Ionization fire alarms detect flaming, fast moving fires – curtain fires, trash can fires, etc. Photoelectric fire alarms are best for smoky, smoldering fires, such as electrical fires that start out behind walls. There are also dual sensor fire alarms which, naturally, combine both types into one. To maximize your fire protection, you should install both types (or a combination of the two) to make sure you are completely covered. \n* * *\nDo I Need Both A Fire Alarm System And A Sprinkler System?\nIn short, yes. Fire sprinkler systems are great for putting out fires after they start, but they only come on once the fire has reached a certain temperature, at which point it will have already done damage. Fire alarm systems, particularly smoke detectors, round out your fire protection because they detect smoke and other gases before the flames start, giving you extra time to escape the building. They can also automatically alert the fire department. \n* * *\nIs Fire Alarm Monitoring Worth It?\nFire alarm monitoring is basically a guarantee your building has eyes on it 24/7, keeping it protected from fires at all times. If the fire alarms go off in your building, the fire alarm monitoring company will notify the fire department within seconds – even if you’re not there, or if you’re in the process of safely evacuating. Everyone has heard horror stories of people showing up to work and seeing the charred wreckage of what was once their office (and all their equipment, data, etc.) – don’t let this happen to you! \n* * *\nHow Do Fire Sprinkler Systems Work?\nMost conventional sprinkler heads use a small, liquid-filled bulb that acts as a plug to prevent water from escaping out of the sprinkler. Extreme heat causes this liquid to expand, eventually causing the bulb to burst and release the water behind it.\n  \n\nThe liquid inside the bulbs comes in a variety of colors, and each color represents the temperature required to activate the sprinkler:\n  * Orange – 135°F\n  * Red – 155°F\n  * Yellow – 174°F\n  * Green – 200°F\n  * Blue – 286°F\n  * Purple – 360°F\n  * Black – 440°F\n\n\n* * *\nDon’t Fire Sprinklers Cause Water Damage?\nYes. But consider the alternatives: either your building burns down, or the fire department arrives and basically floods your building until the fire dies down (remember, fire sprinklers deliver about 18 gpm, whereas firefighter hoses deliver 60 or more!). \n* * *\nWhat Are The Maintenance Requirements For My Fire Extinguishers?\nAnnual inspections, internal maintenance, and hydrostatic testing must be performed by a licensed fire protection company.\n  \n\n  * Monthly inspection by the owner of the fire extinguisher\n  * Annual professional fire extinguisher inspection\n  * Internal (six-year) fire extinguisher maintenance (also referred to as tear down)\n  * Hydrostatic testing every 12 years (five years for vehicle-mounted and some others)\n\n\n  \n\n* * *\n#### Licenses\nACR - 3008843 / SCR-G 3033014 / ECR 3059748\nLicenses: ACR - 3008843 / SCR-G 3033014 / ECR 3059748\nCopyright © 2023 Fulshear Fire & Sprinkler LLC - All Rights Reserved | Disclaimer | Privacy Policy \nPowered by \n  * [Home](https://fulshearfire.com/</>)\n\n\n![](https://img1.wsimg.com/isteam/ip/ba315f06-7dc3-47f2-84f0-c78e84cd60d0/Fire-Marshal-Inspection-Checklist_featured.png/:/cr=t:9.32%25,l:0%25,w:100%25,h:81.36%25/rs=w:515,h:234,cg:true)\n### Need service? \nClick here to send us an email with your request.\n#### This website uses cookies.\nWe use cookies to analyze website traffic and optimize your website experience.
