With rapid feedback cycles, we’ll craft the most satisfying journeys for your users.\n**Web and mobile app development services**. We follow the Agile methodology with short iterations, regular demos, and feedback collection.\n**Quality Assurance and Test Automation**. Our QA engineers ensure the product meets your requirements and has no defects.\n**Project Management** to ensure your product is delivered on time and within budget. Our managers have Project Management Institute (PMI) and Scrum Alliance certifications.\n**DevOps** to build robust automation together with cost-effective /and scalable infrastructure.\n * How much does web application development cost? What is the typical timeline? \nThe cost and timeline vary based on project complexity. \nThey range from $50,000 for a simple proof of concept to $200,000+ for complex enterprise systems. Our web app development agency provides transparent, customized quotes after understanding your requirements. For more information, check out our in-depth explainer on project costs.\nThe first version of a product typically takes 3–4 months to develop, depending on features, integrations, and testing needs. We then continue working with the client to improve and support the product long-term.\n * What sets MindK apart from other web development agencies? \nAs a product studio, we don’t simply create software. MindK dives deep into the client’s business, working side by side to achieve success. From market research to user testing, we ensure your customers remain happy while you grow the business.\n**14+ years of industry expertise**. MindK has built over 170 projects in Healthcare, E-learning, HR & Recruitment, Real Estate, and other industries.\n**Engineering excellence**. MindK employs 87% of Senior and Middle+ software engineers. Most of them began their careers at MindK, growing under the guidance of personal mentors. \n**MindK Product Development Framework (PDF)**. We use pre-built modules and customizable UI elements to save our clients up to 20% of the project’s costs and time.\n * What happens after I fill out the contact form? \n**NDA and intro consultation**\nWe’ll get back to you within 24 hours. Intro consultation aims to learn as much as possible about your business and user needs. With information at hand, we’ll gather a team of experts to analyze the request. Depending on your needs, we might propose a feasibility study or a discovery phase.\n**a) Free feasibility study**\nWe’ll run a few Q&A sessions with your team to elicit more requirements and prepare a rough project estimate. You can then sign a contract with MindK or choose another company.\n**b) Paid discovery phase**\nA deeper investigation usually takes 4 weeks. During this time, we’ll run product discovery workshops with experienced Product Managers, Solution Architects, and UI/UX experts. They’ll help you analyze the market and target users, identify hidden needs, and find optimal solutions to realize your vision. \nAs a result, you’ll get a design concept, solution architecture, a product roadmap with timeframes, and a detailed cost estimate. \n * What is your software development process? \nMindK follows the Scrum methodology. We break the project into smaller Sprints that last 2–4 weeks. Each one starts with a Sprint planning session together with the client representative. Together, we’ll define the Sprint goal, detail the requirements, and re-prioritize the features. \nThe team then starts writing and testing the code to complete the features by the end of the Sprint. You’ll have opportunities to visit daily meetings with developers in addition to regular status updates. Each Sprint ends with a live demo for the client with the ability to try out features. \nWe release the solution to a live environment as soon as you deem it ready. However, our services don’t end with the launch. We’ll continue improving and supporting your solution for as long as necessary.\n * How does MindK ensure security and compliance? \nSecurity is paramount for our web application development company. We use industry best practices, secure cloud services, and conduct regular security audits. Your application will comply with all relevant regulations, such as GDPR, CCPA/CPRA, HIPAA/NIST guidelines, and PCI DSS.\n * How do you ensure high software quality? \n**Comprehensive requirements analysis**\nQuality starts before the development phase. We collaborate closely with the client to understand their business goals, user needs, functional, and non-functional requirements. \nThis phase is crucial in clearly understanding project goals and creating effective test cases. We collaborate with stakeholders to ensure comprehensive testing coverage from the very start.\n**QA and test automation**\nOur web development agency integrates testing into the SDLC. Early detection and resolution of defects reduces costs by addressing issues before they escalate.\nWe use automation whenever possible, aiming for efficiency, repeatability, and scalability. MindK goes beyond traditional test automation with UI End-to-End (E2E) and API testing. We accelerate QA and reduce manual effort with the right tools and frameworks. Speeding up feedback cycles and increasing coverage provides more robust and reliable software.\n**Non-functional testing**\nClient-side and server-side performance testing guarantees optimal functionality under varying loads. We identify and address potential bottlenecks and enhance the overall performance of your software.\nUser experience testing is a key factor in the success of any software. It ensures that your application provides an intuitive and enjoyable experience for end-users.\n**User acceptance testing (UAT)**\nEnsuring that your software meets end user expectations is paramount. We involve end-users in the testing process to obtain valuable feedback for refinement purposes. We address identified issues promptly, emphasizing the importance of delivering a polished, user-friendly product.\n * Do you provide ongoing support? \nYes. Our web app development services don’t end with the launch. We’ll continue with long-term support and maintenance.

They use strong authorization, authentication, and security policies.\nComposite APIs\nallow engineers to bundle requests to several different APIs. This cuts down the total number of interfaces.\nYou can also group APIs depending on the protocols used, including REST, SOAP, GraphQL, gRPC, and more. You can learn more in our\ndetailed article on APIs\n.\nHow much does it cost to develop an API?\nAPI development costs vary from $10,000 to $50,000. Such a wide range is explained by multiple factors that affect the costs. They include the project complexity, API type, quantity of endpoints, technologies and protocols used, and non-functional requirements like security. You can\nshare the project details\nwith MindK to get a more precise quote.\nHow long will it take to build my API?\nAPI development time varies based on many factors. They include the number of endpoints, integrations, team experience, and non-functional requirements. For large, complex APIs, the entire process takes anywhere from 6 months to over a year. We can accelerate this timeline with Agile methodologies and modern API development frameworks.\nWhat engagement models do you offer as an API development company?\nOur\nengagement models\ninclude fixed-price contracts for projects with well-defined requirements. We also offer time and material billing for projects where requirements tend to change over time.\nHow do you ensure that my API is secure?\nMindK follows the latest best practices for API security. Using Amazon Web Services (AWS) gives us access to a lot of helpful services for Web Application Firewalls (WAF), application & infrastructure access control, system monitoring & alerting, and more. We use the platform’s recommended architecture, as well as encrypt the data in transit and at rest if necessary.\nWhat factors should I consider when choosing an API development company?\nBefore you\nhire an API developer\n, consider factors such as the provider’s expertise, experience, and track record. Also, assess their ability to work with your existing systems and provide ongoing support and maintenance.\nHow do I integrate an API into my existing applications?\nThe\nintegration process\nwill depend on the specific API and applications you are working with. Typically, you’ll need to get an API key or access token, which allows your application to authenticate and communicate with the API. You then need to write code into your application that uses the API to access data or functionality.\n## Our approach\n\nWhat is an API in Software Development?

What's the potential ROI?\nTypical healthcare software modernization projects range from $100K to $1M+. The exact sum depends on complexity and scale, regulatory requirements, and the level of architecture changes:\nSmall system modernization costs $100K-$250K.\nMedium complexity (EHR integrations, mid-sized) cost $250K-$750K.\nLarge, enterprise healthcare systems cost $750K-$1M+.\nMost healthcare organizations realize positive ROI within 12-24 months. This includes direct cost savings from reduced maintenance and downtime, improved productivity, reduced compliance risk, and regulatory penalties.\nWhat is the expected downtime?\nMindK uses a phased implementation approach. Careful planning and contingency rollback keep downtime to less than 24 hours. Parallel deployments can achieve near-zero downtime.\nWhat are the risks of healthcare software modernization?\nCommon risks include downtime, potential data loss, budget overruns, and regulatory penalties.\nTo minimize these risks, MindK uses phased deployments, robust rollback strategies, thorough pre-launch testing, data validation and backup, regular cost tracking, and compliance-by-design software modernization.\nWhat are the benefits of application modernization? How will it impact my business?\nHealthcare application modernization services\ncan provide multiple benefits:\nImproved interoperability & integration (FHIR/HL7), enabling seamless clinical workflows.\nReduced clinician burnout due to intuitive, streamlined user interfaces and clinical decision support.\nIncreased security and regulatory compliance (HIPAA, FDA, CMS Interoperability rules).\nCost reductions from automated processes, reduced downtime, and lower maintenance overhead.\nEnhanced patient experience and clinical outcomes through responsive, reliable applications.\nWhat are the 5 R's of application modernization?\nThe\n5 R’s framework\ndescribes modernization strategies:\nRehost\n: lift and shift legacy apps directly to cloud infrastructure with minimal changes.\nRefactor\n: restructure code to optimize existing features and improve performance without major functionality changes.\nRe-architect\n: transform the application structure significantly, e.g., monolith to microservices or serverless architecture.\nRebuild\n: completely redevelop the application from scratch, leveraging modern technologies.\nReplace\n: fully retire legacy software, replacing it entirely with new solutions or commercial SaaS alternatives.\nHealthcare typically favors the Refactor, Re-architect, or Rebuild approaches for compliance and interoperability advantages.\n### Modernize your healthcare software\nLet us know about your technology challenges.

Students will be required to complete a very thorough Participation Agreement and Release of Liability prior to participation in any training. Minors are not permitted to attend any Tactical Consultants training unless previously scheduled as a private, 1/1 training with the student and parent or guardian present at all times. Students will need to review and have a working knowledge of the **Cardinal Safety Rules.** There are course prerequisites: Pistol Phase 1 is a prereq for Phase 2 pistol and AR-15 Phase 1 is a prereq for Phase 2 AR-15. There is no prereq for Concealed Carry and Home Defense, Intro to Handgun, Intro to AR-15, or Shotgun.\n##### What gear do I need for class? \nEach class has its own gear list. You can see what is needed in the Required Equipment section on each class page.\n##### What time do we start class?\nUnless notified of a different time slot, all full and half-day training starts at 8 am sharp.\n##### What if I don’t have a firearm?\nFor any class, it is highly recommended that you come to training with the firearm you use to defend your life so you become proficient with that gun. However, rental pistols are available for training if needed. AR-15s and Shotguns are only available for rent during private, 1/1 training.\n##### Can I purchase ammunition?\nTactical Consultants sells ammunition for class but due to unforeseen ammunition shortages that come and go, please arrange this prior to your training date so that it can be made available.\n##### Should I bring lunch/snacks? \nYes, for full days you will need to bring lunch, some snacks, and a full water bottle or two. During half-day training events, you will still need some snacks for fuel and plenty of water.\n##### I enrolled and paid for a class, can I get a refund?\nAll training sales are final, there are no refunds given. Other students have waited for training when enrolled students cancel last minute or are no-shows. It is unfair to those students. Please do not sign up for a class if you believe there is a possibility you may cancel.\n##### When attending a rifle class, should I have my rifle setup complete and zeroed?\nYes, please have your rifle set up the way you want to train with it and have it zeroed for a 50/200 yard zero, other zero distances are acceptable and we can help fine-tune your zero during the first hour of training.\n##### What are Tactical Consultants Cardinal Rules?\n**1. Always treat every firearm as if it were loaded.** Over the many years of working in firearm instruction, both with law enforcement personnel and private citizens, I must shake my head at the many accidents that occur and are labeled “negligent” or “accidental” discharges. These accidents occur, many resulting in death or grave bodily harm because the people handling the firearm are treating it as an everyday object, rather than a tool, capable of taking a human life. Once we place human intervention into the equation, these avoidable accidents occur with what should be an otherwise inert object. During my firearms instruction and while discussing the universal safety rules, I advise my students to not only treat every firearm as if it were loaded but more importantly, ALWAYS KNOW THE STATUS OF YOUR WEAPON! In other words, is your firearm ready to help protect you when it matters the most, at a second’s notice? A loaded weapon is not an unsafe weapon. It’s the individual handling the weapon that creates the unsafe situation. I always conduct press checks to confirm the status of a LOADED weapon. I am already considering the weapon loaded for the purpose of providing a safe environment for myself and the people around me, however, it’s the confirmation that I actually loaded it with a round in the chamber prior to holstering and trusting that weapon with my life when headed out for the day. This was drilled into me as a young police officer. Assuming the gun is loaded when finding yourself in a life-or-death incident, and a round is not chambered, well, that won’t fare well for your response to the critical incident you’re faced with.\n**2. Always point your firearm in a safe direction unless defending yourself or others.** Pointing your firearm at an assailant may be the safest direction! Making the statement, “do not point your firearm at anything you're not willing to shoot, kill or destroy,” is not an accurate statement in my opinion. There are common situations where we will point our firearms in directions or at something “we do not wish to destroy.” With this universal safety rule, many instructors will use the laser rule, and I think that is a good way of conceptualizing the muzzle or barrel end of your firearm. With an imaginary laser shooting out from the end of your barrel, you want to prevent that laser from crossing paths with you or anyone else. A question you should ask yourself is when would the laser be “OFF,” where you may be able to point that weapon at yourself or a part of your body? Usually students will respond, it’s always ON. However, what about when a holstered pistol is on your hip or carried in the appendix position? The muzzle will be aiming directly at your hip, legs, calves, or feet. So, we can say that a properly holstered weapon’s laser is OFF until a person interacts with that weapon. My safety on a weapon is my self-discipline, training, and the holster that safely covers the entire trigger. In life, if something is about to drop to the ground such as a cell phone, or a valuable fragile item, our natural response is to attempt to catch it and prevent it from striking the ground. However, that is exactly what we don’t want to do with a gun. A weapon slipping from your grip, holster or otherwise, is out of control and the barrel is flying around pointing in multiple unsafe directions. So let it go. Attempting to catch it and inadvertently pressing the trigger is likely to happen and we want to avoid that at all costs. Most modern weapons of today are very safe and can take a considerable drop without discharging a round.\n**3. Always keep your finger off the trigger and high up on the frame until you are ready to fire.** My first safety on a weapon is my trigger finger. My second, and stated above in rule #2, my holster is my external safety on my weapon. In my opinion, external safeties on every day carry firearms can present a problem for most people that fail to train and train frequently. In a high stress self-defense incident, you are not going to be thinking about disengaging a safety on a pistol. So having your trigger finger positioned high on the frame or slide is the best place, not along the trigger guard where I was taught during my law enforcement career. A sympathetic response and flinch can cause that trigger finger to retract and pull back into where your hand is making a fist, causing your index finger to press the trigger.\n**4. Always be sure of your target and what is beyond.** Also, be aware of your entire surrounding area! Not just the backstop. This is the embodiment of situational awareness in a gunfight. Be sure of what is also left and right, as you must be paying attention to your entire surroundings. The ABSOLUTE APPLICATION OF SITUATIONAL AWARENESS. Like wolves, criminals will usually travel in packs and they typically don’t operate alone. At the very least, that is what we should be aware of and ready for. There may be additional threats to engage, including assaults, drug violence, robberies, home invasions, etc. In any violent encounter, expect the assailants to be accompanied by another criminal or co-defendant. You may need to transition to the next target or threat level and continue to defend yourself and your loved ones. This rule is the absolute application of situational awareness while manipulating your firearm, by not only paying attention to the backstop but to your ENTIRE SURROUNDING. So, the ultimate goal at the end of the day is to survive and go home alive, not only for yourself but more importantly, for your loved ones.\n**5. Be attentive and careful all the time.**\n**6. If you see a dangerous situation, report it to a range instructor directly.**\n**7. Absolutely no use of drugs or alcohol.** Instructors must be made aware of clients' use of prescription drugs that may cause a safety hazard.\n## Ready to Get Started?\nTraining & Classes\nContact Us\nRecaptcha requires verification. \n- \nprotected by **reCAPTCHA**\n-\n\n### [PAGE] https://tactical-consultants.com/about\nWelcome to Tactical Consultants\n## About Us\n## Tactical Consultants\n### A Strong Start\nDamon Smith is the owner/founder and head instructor of Tactical Consultants LLC firearms sales and training facility. Damon was fortunate to grow up around firearms with his father and it wasn’t uncommon to have those firearms accessible to him as he grew up. His father taught him well about firearms safety, eliminated the “curiosity” guns seem to have with children and taught him an overall strong level of respect for the firearms in their household. Damon grew up shooting at gun ranges with his family and hunting with his Dad. At a very young age, his father taught him how to reload ammunition, and by age 15 Damon had a complete ammunition reloading station in his bedroom making various ammunition calibers from rifle to handgun!\n### Experienced in Training Others\nEarly in his twenties, Damon became a police officer where he served 20 years with various agencies and the Federal Government. He became an instructor/trainer very early in his career as a Field Training Officer teaching new police officers on road patrol. Damon also served as an Operator and Scout on a Mutual Aid SWAT/HRT team, tasked to service many cities for high-risk search warrants, barricaded gunmen, hostage rescue, and other incidents they would be called upon. Not long after, he was promoted to a firearms instructor and served for many years teaching in his agency’s firearms training division. This division not only taught police officers at the live fire range but also worked with officers in patrol operations, scenarios and simunition training. Damon was then asked to take over the AR-15/Patrol Rifle training for the department where he completely redesigned the course curriculum to teach both new and veteran officers how to implement the rifle on everyday patrol.\n### Transition to Civilian Sector\nHis police department started offering concealed pistol training classes for Judges, employees, friends, family, and retired police officers, certified under the Michigan Commission on Law Enforcement Standards. This is where he started transitioning to teaching the citizen side of firearms training and helped to certify many people in earning their concealed pistol licenses. Damon is also a certified concealed pistol and home defense instructor with the USCCA/United States Concealed Carry Association. Damon completed his Law Enforcement career as a Detective serving in his agency’s Bureau of Investigations.\n### Real World Experience Now Available to You\nDamon has been very passionate and serious about his training and being the best possible instructor with his fellow police officers, so they had every possible advantage to survive and go home to their families at the end of their shift. Now, Damon hopes to share this same passion and drive to help others exercise their 2nd Amendment right to confidently carry a firearm for the protection of themselves and their loved ones.\n\n## Ready to Get Started?\nTraining & Classes\nContact Us\n\n### [PAGE] https://tactical-consultants.com/firearms-for-sale\nWelcome to Tactical Consultants\n## Firearms for Sale\nIn addition to Tactical Consultants training programs, we are also a full service Federally Licensed Dealer.\nFor in stock inventory, we only carry EDC (every day carry) firearms that we truly believe in and trust with our own lives.

Students will be required to complete a very thorough Participation Agreement and Release of Liability prior to participation in any training. Minors are not permitted to attend any Tactical Consultants training unless previously scheduled as a private, 1/1 training with the student and parent or guardian present at all times. Students will need to review and have a working knowledge of theCardinal Safety Rules\n.\nThere are course prerequisites: Pistol Phase 1 is a prereq for Phase 2 pistol and AR-15 Phase 1 is a prereq for Phase 2 AR-15. There is no prereq for Concealed Carry and Home Defense, Intro to Handgun, Intro to AR-15, or Shotgun.\n##### What gear do I need for class?\nEach class has its own gear list. You can see what is needed in the Required Equipment section on each class page.\n##### What time do we start class?\nUnless notified of a different time slot, all full and half-day training starts at 8 am sharp.\n##### What if I don’t have a firearm?\nFor any class, it is highly recommended that you come to training with the firearm you use to defend your life so you become proficient with that gun. However, rental pistols are available for training if needed. AR-15s and Shotguns are only available for rent during private, 1/1 training.\n##### Can I purchase ammunition?\nTactical Consultants sells ammunition for class but due to unforeseen ammunition shortages that come and go, please arrange this prior to your training date so that it can be made available.\n##### Should I bring lunch/snacks?\nYes, for full days you will need to bring lunch, some snacks, and a full water bottle or two. During half-day training events, you will still need some snacks for fuel and plenty of water.\n##### I enrolled and paid for a class, can I get a refund?\nAll training sales are final, there are no refunds given. Other students have waited for training when enrolled students cancel last minute or are no-shows. It is unfair to those students. Please do not sign up for a class if you believe there is a possibility you may cancel.\n##### When attending a rifle class, should I have my rifle setup complete and zeroed?\nYes, please have your rifle set up the way you want to train with it and have it zeroed for a 50/200 yard zero, other zero distances are acceptable and we can help fine-tune your zero during the first hour of training.\n##### What are Tactical Consultants Cardinal Rules?\n1. Always treat every firearm as if it were loaded.\nOver the many years of working in firearm instruction, both with law enforcement personnel and private citizens, I must shake my head at the many accidents that occur and are labeled “negligent” or “accidental” discharges. These accidents occur, many resulting in death or grave bodily harm because the people handling the firearm are treating it as an everyday object, rather than a tool, capable of taking a human life. Once we place human intervention into the equation, these avoidable accidents occur with what should be an otherwise inert object. During my firearms instruction and while discussing the universal safety rules, I advise my students to not only treat every firearm as if it were loaded but more importantly, ALWAYS KNOW THE STATUS OF YOUR WEAPON! In other words, is your firearm ready to help protect you when it matters the most, at a second’s notice? A loaded weapon is not an unsafe weapon. It’s the individual handling the weapon that creates the unsafe situation. I always conduct press checks to confirm the status of a LOADED weapon. I am already considering the weapon loaded for the purpose of providing a safe environment for myself and the people around me, however, it’s the confirmation that I actually loaded it with a round in the chamber prior to holstering and trusting that weapon with my life when headed out for the day. This was drilled into me as a young police officer. Assuming the gun is loaded when finding yourself in a life-or-death incident, and a round is not chambered, well, that won’t fare well for your response to the critical incident you’re faced with.\n2. Always point your firearm in a safe direction unless defending yourself or others.\nPointing your firearm at an assailant may be the safest direction! Making the statement, “do not point your firearm at anything you're not willing to shoot, kill or destroy,” is not an accurate statement in my opinion. There are common situations where we will point our firearms in directions or at something “we do not wish to destroy.” With this universal safety rule, many instructors will use the laser rule, and I think that is a good way of conceptualizing the muzzle or barrel end of your firearm. With an imaginary laser shooting out from the end of your barrel, you want to prevent that laser from crossing paths with you or anyone else. A question you should ask yourself is when would the laser be “OFF,” where you may be able to point that weapon at yourself or a part of your body? Usually students will respond, it’s always ON. However, what about when a holstered pistol is on your hip or carried in the appendix position? The muzzle will be aiming directly at your hip, legs, calves, or feet. So, we can say that a properly holstered weapon’s laser is OFF until a person interacts with that weapon. My safety on a weapon is my self-discipline, training, and the holster that safely covers the entire trigger. In life, if something is about to drop to the ground such as a cell phone, or a valuable fragile item, our natural response is to attempt to catch it and prevent it from striking the ground. However, that is exactly what we don’t want to do with a gun. A weapon slipping from your grip, holster or otherwise, is out of control and the barrel is flying around pointing in multiple unsafe directions. So let it go. Attempting to catch it and inadvertently pressing the trigger is likely to happen and we want to avoid that at all costs. Most modern weapons of today are very safe and can take a considerable drop without discharging a round.\n3. Always keep your finger off the trigger and high up on the frame until you are ready to fire.\nMy first safety on a weapon is my trigger finger. My second, and stated above in rule #2, my holster is my external safety on my weapon. In my opinion, external safeties on every day carry firearms can present a problem for most people that fail to train and train frequently. In a high stress self-defense incident, you are not going to be thinking about disengaging a safety on a pistol. So having your trigger finger positioned high on the frame or slide is the best place, not along the trigger guard where I was taught during my law enforcement career. A sympathetic response and flinch can cause that trigger finger to retract and pull back into where your hand is making a fist, causing your index finger to press the trigger.\n4. Always be sure of your target and what is beyond.\nAlso, be aware of your entire surrounding area! Not just the backstop. This is the embodiment of situational awareness in a gunfight. Be sure of what is also left and right, as you must be paying attention to your entire surroundings. The ABSOLUTE APPLICATION OF SITUATIONAL AWARENESS. Like wolves, criminals will usually travel in packs and they typically don’t operate alone. At the very least, that is what we should be aware of and ready for. There may be additional threats to engage, including assaults, drug violence, robberies, home invasions, etc. In any violent encounter, expect the assailants to be accompanied by another criminal or co-defendant. You may need to transition to the next target or threat level and continue to defend yourself and your loved ones. This rule is the absolute application of situational awareness while manipulating your firearm, by not only paying attention to the backstop but to your ENTIRE SURROUNDING. So, the ultimate goal at the end of the day is to survive and go home alive, not only for yourself but more importantly, for your loved ones.\n5. Be attentive and careful all the time.\n6. If you see a dangerous situation, report it to a range instructor directly.\n7. Absolutely no use of drugs or alcohol.\nInstructors must be made aware of clients' use of prescription drugs that may cause a safety hazard.\nNotifications\nRecaptcha requires verification.\n-\nprotected byreCAPTCHA\n-", "included_urls": ["https://tactical-consultants.com", "https://tactical-consultants.com/about", "https://tactical-consultants.com/firearms-for-sale", "https://tactical-consultants.com/class/private-firearms-instruction"], "overflow": false, "length": {"chars": 38062, "approx_tokens": 9516}, "html_keywords_found": ["NFPA"], "record_id": "37875295245", "crawl_status": "SUCCESS", "failure_reason": null, "pages_visited": 6, "Record ID": "37875295245", "Company name": "Tactical Consultants", "NA State": "Michigan", "State/County": "Michigan", "Country": "United States", "Company Domain Name": "tactical-consultants.com", "Phone Number": "+1 248-885-3113", "Company owner": "", "Lead Status": "", "Clay score": "10", "Associated Note": "", "Current Software": "", "Current Software Contract End Date": "", "Core service": "Other", "Accounting software (US)": "", "Industry_": "Other", "Client Use Case": "", "Associated Note IDs": "", "Perform Search": "https://www.linkedin.com/company/tactical-consultants (+4)", "Link To Google Search": "https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Alinkedin.com%2Fcompany%20%2B%20tactical-consultants.com&hl=en&gl=us", "Results Returned Count": "5", "Serper Link": "https://www.linkedin.com/company/tactical-consultants", "Enrich Company": "Tactical Consultants", "Founded": "", "Employee Count": "4", "Website": "http://www.tactical-consultants.com", "Find Contacts at Company": "❌ No Profile Found", "PIC 1 Name": "", "PIC 1 TItle": "", "PIC 1 URL": "", "PIC 1 Contact Info": "", "PIC 2 Name": "", "PIC 2 Title": "", "PIC 2 URL": "", "PIC 2 Contact Info": "  ", "Find Contacts at Company (2)": "", "PIC 3 Name": "", "PIC 3 Title": "", "PIC 3 URL": "", "PIC 3 Contact Info": "  ", "CEO LinkedIn URL (2)": "", "Linkedin Url": "", "classification_category": "Other", "rationale": "The company focuses on firearm training, sales, and FFL transfers, which fall outside the scope of fire protection systems.

A question that we are often asked is; “How do I know if there is a problem?” Well, without running detailed tests, you can’t be sure, but there are certain symptoms that may indicate that you have air quality issues. These include; feeling dizzy or light-headed, skin irritation, sore eyes, congested nasal passages, bouts of sneezing and generally feeling “out of sorts.”\nIf you want to make sure that you and your family are safe from potential pollution issues, you need to have your environment tested. And it is important that this is done by a qualified, licensed, professional. \nThe specific tests that are needed to determine the quality of the air around you can differ from region to region, so at SafeNest Environmental Testing we can prepare an indoor air quality testing plan specifically for Spokane and the surrounding areas. (Of course, we can also do the same for any other area of the country!)\n## Why Should You Test?\n\n#### Ensure Good Air Quality\n\n#### Identify Potential Problems\n\n#### Check Before Selling\n\n#### Reduce Chances of Illness\n\n#### Improve General Well-being\n~\n#### Create Safe Environment\n## Get More Details\nContact Us Now\n\n### [PAGE] https://safenestenviro.com/contact-us\nYour Name (required)\nYour Email (required)\nSubject\nYour Message\nΔ\n\n### [PAGE] https://safenestenviro.com/air-quality\nU\n#### What is Air Quality?\nInside air quality (IAQ) is a way to refer to a quantifiable concentration of contaminants in the atmosphere content of a building. The quality of air can vary from good to, in extreme cases, life threatening.\n\nPoor air quality can result in respiration problems, allergic reactions or similar issues; including headaches, tiredness, nausea and a diminished immune system. These issues affect countless individuals every day: this makes indoor air-quality a buzz-word of the twentieth century and illustrates why it is important to make sure that the air you breathe at home and at work, is not harming you or your family or employees. Ironically, the move to sealing houses better to improve heating/cooling efficiency has led to an increase in problems with air quality and an increased hypersensitivity to pollutants. To combat this, in 1970, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) established threshold standards for air pollution, designed to protect human health. Initially, the standards were concerned specifically with the carcinogenicity of chemicals present in homes and workplaces, but those guidelines have since been expanded to cover other areas of potential pollution.\nSome of the main causes of indoor air pollution are:\nAllergens and pollutants\nFormaldehyde\nCarbon monoxide\n## Ready to Get Started?\nTo learn more about our Environmental Testing Servicesclick below, or contact us at\nContact Us\n\n### [PAGE] https://safenestenviro.com/fire-and-smoke-testing\nU\n#### Fire and Smoke Testing\nHave you had a fire in your property and need post-fire testing? Call SafeNest Environmental Testing today at\n## What Areas Were Impacted by Fire?\nAfter a fire there are some areas that are clearly impacted. There are visible signs of smoke, char, ash, soot, and general damage. But as you move away from the source of the fire, the extent of smoke damage may not be as discerning.\nSetting up the scope of work after a fire is challenging and often based on “eye-balling” it. SafeNest Environmental Testing performs testing to delineate the affected areas. This can save the property owner or insurance company thousands of dollars by establishing the full extent of the damage. SafeNest Environmental Testing is often hired as an independent 3rd party consultant to help settle disputes between insurance companies and property owners.\n## Is It Safe to Go Back In?\nAnother important question our fire testing can answer is whether or not it is safe to reoccupy a space. After fire damage restoration, there may be lingering concern that the space is still harmful to health. With all the plastic and synthetic materials being used today, fires can give off toxic chemicals such as dioxins, furans, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). These chemicals cause effects such as birth defects, neurological effects, and cancer.\nSafeNest Environmental Testing can provide a variety of testing to determine if the fire restoration work was successful at removing smoke residue and harmful volatile organic compounds.\n## Fire and Smoke Testing- How Is It Done?\nSafeNest Environmental Testing starts with a more basic, less expensive method and work our way up depending on the complexity of the project.\nWe start with a visual inspection and incorporate the use of a chem sponge, also known as a dry sponge, which is made from vulcanized natural rubber. By swiping the sponge across surfaces, we can see the accumulation of particles. A black discoloration is indicative of fire-related particles and a white or light gray discoloration is indicative of normal house dust. Unfortunately, this method cannot distinguish between smoke residue from fires and other combustion such as fireplaces, candle burning, and cigarette smoking. To better determine the source of smoke residue, laboratory testing is needed.\nThe simplest lab test involves a tape-lift sample. The laboratory uses various forms of light microscopy to look for char particles, which are larger than smaller soot particles. To determine the presence of soot, a wipe sample is needed. Soot samples are typically collected if the char samples were inconclusive.\nThe most complex post-fire samples test for complex chemical residues such as dioxins and PAHs. These chemicals are non-volatile or semi-volatile and can be detected on surfaces.\nSafeNest Environmental Testing can also test for fire-related odors. We test for a panel of chemicals that are typically associated with “smoke odors”. This testing is helpful in settling disputes between property owners and restoration contractors.\nCallSafeNest Environmental Testing\nBoard-Certified Fire and Smoke Damage Consultants\n## Ready to Get Started?\nTo learn more about our Environmental Testing Servicesclick below, or contact us at\nContact Us", "included_urls": ["https://safenestenviro.com", "https://safenestenviro.com/contact-us", "https://safenestenviro.com/air-quality", "https://safenestenviro.com/fire-and-smoke-testing"], "overflow": false, "length": {"chars": 7088, "approx_tokens": 1772}, "html_keywords_found": [], "record_id": "37876533604", "crawl_status": "SUCCESS", "failure_reason": null, "pages_visited": 6, "Record ID": "37876533604", "Company name": "SafeNest Environmental Testing LLC", "NA State": "Washington", "State/County": "Washington", "Country": "United States", "Company Domain Name": "safenestenviro.com", "Phone Number": "+1 509-720-0190", "Company owner": "", "Lead Status": "", "Clay score": "10", "Associated Note": "", "Current Software": "", "Current Software Contract End Date": "", "Core service": "Other", "Accounting software (US)": "", "Industry_": "Other", "Client Use Case": "", "Associated Note IDs": "", "Perform Search": "No Results", "Link To Google Search": "", "Results Returned Count": "", "Serper Link": "", "Enrich Company": "❌ Company Not Found", "Founded": "", "Employee Count": "", "Website": "", "Find Contacts at Company": "", "PIC 1 Name": "", "PIC 1 TItle": "", "PIC 1 URL": "", "PIC 1 Contact Info": "", "PIC 2 Name": "", "PIC 2 Title": "", "PIC 2 URL": "", "PIC 2 Contact Info": "  ", "Find Contacts at Company (2)": "❌ Company Not Found", "PIC 3 Name": "", "PIC 3 Title": "", "PIC 3 URL": "", "PIC 3 Contact Info": "  ", "CEO LinkedIn URL (2)": "", "Linkedin Url": "", "classification_category": "Other", "rationale": "The company specializes in environmental testing services such as fire and smoke residue analysis, mold testing, and air quality assessment, which fall outside the scope of traditional fire protection system installations or maintenance.

Over the next 30+ years, our services, equipment and coverage area have grown. We respond to approximately 1,530 calls a year while offering Advanced Life Support (ALS) to the surrounding communities of Fall River County, as well as southern parts of Custer County, including Wind Cave National Park. \n \nOur ambulances are staffed with both ALS and BLS crews 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Since we have staffing made up of both volunteer and full time staff, we are able to work out of two to five ambulances, depending on the state of trucks and equipment and the availability of volunteers. Currently, the residents of Fall River County can rely on two fully staffed ambulances ready to respond to a 911 dispatch call 24/7, with the potential of a third volunteer crew being available.

Over the next 30+ years, our services, equipment and coverage area have grown. We respond to approximately 1,530 calls a year while offering Advanced Life Support (ALS) to the surrounding communities of Fall River County, as well as southern parts of Custer County, including Wind Cave National Park.Our ambulances are staffed with both ALS and BLS crews 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Since we have staffing made up of both volunteer and full time staff, we are able to work out of two to five ambulances, depending on the state of trucks and equipment and the availability of volunteers. Currently, the residents of Fall River County can rely on two fully staffed ambulances ready to respond to a 911 dispatch call 24/7, with the potential of a third volunteer crew being available. Our staff is made up of local individuals as well as individuals who travel from surrounding areas.\n\nPlay\nPause\n## What We Do\nBLS (Basic Life Support)\ncrews have been trained to respond to a variety of traumatic and medical emergencies over the course of approximately 4 months, as well as passing state and national testing.

These advanced tools replace obsolete, awkward traditional wildfire hand tools of the previous century that are still in use by a majority of today’s firefighters.\nThe centerpiece of Dragonslayers tools is the, Universal Wildfire Tool Kit (shown here) includes a Universal Handle, and three attachable tool heads. \n\n * \n * \n * \n * \n\n[](\nBecause Dragonslayers manufactures the wildfire hand tools, the customer benefits by being able to purchase **DIRECTLY FROM THE FACTORY.** **FACTORY-DIRECT** purchases mean personalized service from the Dragonslayers’ team, next-day shipping, no “middle-man” fees and costs, and no government administrative and warehousing costs for an order.\nUse our e-store to order tools or phone directly to Troop Emonds at Dragonslayers, 503.812.6974.\n**Watch Troop’sLatest Video on Fighting Urban-Wildlands Interface Wildfire**\n * Dragonslayers Tools\n * Training\n * Tool Customers\n\nDRAGONSLAYERS tools are a product of U.S. Department of Agriculture Small Business Innovation and Research Grants awarded in the 1990’s to Dragonslayers, Inc. to address weaknesses and limitations of the traditional Pulaski and 14 other traditional wildfire fighting tools. The result of that research was the development of a simple wildfire tool system designed to resolve those weaknesses and to create extremely durable compact tools that would replace the multitude of cumbersome and dangerous single-function firefighting hand tools used on wildland fires.\nDRAGONSLAYERS tools are engineered as **“Tool Kits“** centered around a **“Universal Handle“** and **“Tool Heads”** consisting of the “**Magnum Pulaski” **(cutting axe/grub-hoe), **“Troop Tool” **(an advanced shovel/scraping tool) and the “**Dragon Swatter“** (long-strap swatter for grass ecosystems) for use in a variety of ecosystems and fuel types, and to provide firefighters with the flexibility to respond to changing fuels and conditions on a fire. The single Universal Handle with attachable Magnum Pulaski, swatter and shovel tool heads allows firefighters a high level of mobility when responding to the fire, fighting the fire, mopping up and packing out. These tools are extremely durable and Pulaski and shovel blades and the Universal Handle can be refurbished when they wear out. There are Hotshot crews who have had their DRAGONSLAYERS Magnum Pulaskis re-bladed as many as five times on the original Pulaski composite tool head, a tremendous cost saving and a green alternative to replacing conventional tools after one or two fire seasons! \nDRAGONSLAYERS, Inc. also provides training for landowners living in high-risk wildfire-prone areas to reduce fuels on their property and to develop a defensive perimeter around structures and properties. In this capacity, DRAGONSLAYERS has trained fire agency personnel and homeowners in the western United States, as well as overseas in Spain, Russia and France. Read more.\n**Agency Firefighters.** DRAGONSLAYERS wildfire hand tools were designed and developed for fighting wildfires in the 21st Century and specifically for the Federal, State, Tribal and local firefighters. Today’s effective wildfire fighting requires rapid response, mobility and prime wildfire tools that are versatile, durable, compact and dependable. These tools have been designed for ease in transport, whether on the backs of firefighters, in tool boxes for Smokejumpering or Helitack, or tucked into a compartment on an Engine Module. Even Rappeller Crews have discovered the tools, recognizing the compact design and flexibility to be able to address varying fire conditions using the variety of Dragonslayer tools.\nAgency fire crews having **“Crew-level purchasing authority”** are able to purchase tools directly from Dragonslayers, Inc. using a credit card. With the recent shift in tool purchasing procedures from the Government Services Administration (GSA) to the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), wildland fire agencies are now faced with a host of membership and administrative and mark-up fees that greatly increase the cost and complexity of purchasing wildfire hand tools.

Dragonslayers hand tools are perfectly designed to serve the needs of land managers and private homeowners. The tools are compact, stow easily in vehicles, and are extremely durable.\n**International Fire Agencies.** For the past ten years, Dragonslayers has provided wildfire hand tools to fire agencies in Spain, New Zealand, Canada, Ireland, and Russia.

These advanced tools replace obsolete, awkward traditional wildfire hand tools of the previous century that are still in use by a majority of today’s firefighters.\nThe centerpiece of Dragonslayers tools is the,Universal Wildfire Tool Kit\n(shown here) includes aUniversal Handle\n, and three attachable tool heads.\n\nBecause Dragonslayers manufactures the wildfire hand tools, the customer benefits by being able to purchaseDIRECTLY FROM THE FACTORY.\nFACTORY-DIRECT\npurchases mean personalized service from the Dragonslayers’ team, next-day shipping, no “middle-man” fees and costs, and no government administrative and warehousing costs for an order.\nUse our e-store to order tools or phone directly to Troop Emonds at Dragonslayers, 503.812.6974.\nWatch Troop’sLatest Video\non Fighting Urban-Wildlands Interface Wildfire\nDragonslayers Tools\nTraining\nTool Customers\nDRAGONSLAYERS tools are a product of U.S. Department of Agriculture Small Business Innovation and Research Grants awarded in the 1990’s to Dragonslayers, Inc. to address weaknesses and limitations of the traditional Pulaski and 14 other traditional wildfire fighting tools. The result of that research was the development of a simple wildfire tool system designed to resolve those weaknesses and to create extremely durable compact tools that would replace the multitude of cumbersome and dangerous single-function firefighting hand tools used on wildland fires.DRAGONSLAYERS tools are engineered as“Tool Kits\n“\ncentered around a“Universal Handle\n“\nand“Tool Heads”\nconsisting of the “Magnum Pulaski\n”\n(cutting axe/grub-hoe),“Troop Tool\n”\n(an advanced shovel/scraping tool) and the “Dragon Swatter\n“\n(long-strap swatter for grass ecosystems) for use in a variety of ecosystems and fuel types, and to provide firefighters with the flexibility to respond to changing fuels and conditions on a fire. The single Universal Handle with attachable Magnum Pulaski, swatter and shovel tool heads allows firefighters a high level of mobility when responding to the fire, fighting the fire, mopping up and packing out. These tools are extremely durable and Pulaski and shovel blades and the Universal Handle can be refurbished when they wear out. There are Hotshot crews who have had their DRAGONSLAYERS Magnum Pulaskis re-bladed as many as five times on the original Pulaski composite tool head, a tremendous cost saving and a green alternative to replacing conventional tools after one or two fire seasons!\nDRAGONSLAYERS, Inc. also provides training for landowners living in high-risk wildfire-prone areas to reduce fuels on their property and to develop a defensive perimeter around structures and properties. In this capacity, DRAGONSLAYERS has trained fire agency personnel and homeowners in the western United States, as well as overseas in Spain, Russia and France.Read more\n.\nAgency Firefighters.\nDRAGONSLAYERS wildfire hand tools were designed and developed for fighting wildfires in the 21st Century and specifically for the Federal, State, Tribal and local firefighters.

These tools have been designed for ease in transport, whether on the backs of firefighters, in tool boxes for Smokejumpering or Helitack, or tucked into a compartment on an Engine Module.

We have adapted the use of heavy duty, high quality Aluminum instead of using wood, custom designed metal or plastic. The result was a product that lasts longer and holds up after years of abuse from the equipment you use. Aluminum does not warp, rot or fade like wood and does not rust like steel. Plastic is a softer material, therefore, it will potentially wear out after years of heavy tool use.\n### Quality Products\nDon’t let the fact that our products are all custom aluminum make you think we are unaffordable! We use High quality aluminum alloy and our products are constructed utilizing several finishing processes, such as anodizing, powder coating and Plastisol dipping, that provide quality for years to come. We are so confident that our products will work for you, that we offer a one year replacement guarantee. If you break it, we will send you a new one. It’s that simple!!\n### Designed for Function\nAt Zephyr Industries, we understand that organization and functionality are paramount. Our products are designed to organize your equipment to be easily deployed during an emergency. We take pride in personally hand building all of our products from the ground up to ensure quality. All our products are made in Ashland, Ohio.\nWe offer solutions for Fire Departments, Manufacturing Industry, Trucking, Government as well as the private sector. If you have a special item that you need, please don’t hesitate to ask.\n### Family Owned\nZephyr is now a Brown Family owned business.

I would walk the forest, talking to spirits and praying to ancestors. What lies beyond never scared me —**but I feared being rejected for who I was.** I shut down my gifts, trying to walk a more ‘normal’ path. My gifts showed up again and again, at home, at my job, and in yoga classes. But each time I was faced with my power, I ran from it. \n * I was still attracted to healing modalities, but I sought more traditional routes. **I received my masters in social work** and became a mental health therapist. Still, I couldn’t help feeling as though there was more I could be doing outside the confines of a conventional healing structure, but I was scared that my life would irreparably change if I embraced my abilities. \n * Once I moved from my hometown and started surrounding myself with other intuitives, that fear began to dissipate. But after years of ignoring Spirit, I**was faced with a Dark Night of the Soul.** Working to heal deep wounds from a traumatic childhood, clear generational trauma, and lift the karmic weight of past lives, I gradually found my way. \n * After years of honing my intuition, guiding hundreds of clients to their gifts, and creating several healing mentorship programs, **I developed the Intuitive Empowerment Method.** While so many methods fail to incorporate the vital elements of trauma informed care, IEM is rooted in a holistic approach to trauma, not just for clients, but practitioners as well. \n * **Speaking as a published, award-winning author** in the field of practitioner anxiety and burnout, we all have a duty to care for ourselves deeply through community, accountability, and spiritual boundaries. This work has shown me that everybody has unique abilities and that spirituality does not need to be so serious! Spirit is joyful, funny, and full of unconditional love.\n * I’ve worked with countless people who carry stories just like mine. I’m here to tell you that **what you hear and see is real.** The life you feel called to lead is waiting for you, and I’m proud to welcome you exactly as you are, offering gentle guidance as you find your way.

We can help you provide that cleanliness. As you know, many of your patients spend most, if not all of their waking (and some sleeping) hours in their wheelchairs or recliners. They eat, drink, and go about their daily life dependent on this equipment.\n## Kitchen Deep Cleaning\nWhen we come into a kitchen, our goal is to leave it definitively improved from when we came in. We want you to know that our services will improve the productivity, cleanliness, and safety of your work environment. With a good dietary staff, we can keep your kitchens State ready all year instead of just during “open book.” We guarantee our work every time, every service. We will check in with your staff and make sure they are happy with our work. Our quarterly services can be an integral part of your infection control program.\n\n### [PAGE] https://fikesici.com/services/hcsds\n## High Contact Surface Disinfection Service (HCSDS)\nTheFikes High Contact Surface Disinfection Service\nis a three-step process that is performed throughout your building to eliminate infectious material including bacteria, the common cold, pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS), the flu and other viruses such as COVID-19.\n\nSTEP 1\nSpraying an area with disinfectant will not kill some of these new viruses. The biofilm that protects these microbes must be cut or torn open to allow disinfectant to render infectious material inert (no longer a threat). We make sure that these microbes are killed and not just moved around.\nSTEP 2\nDisinfectant applied with a specialized sprayer that ensures the solution is applied evenly and with total coverage. This technology “wraps around” surfaces and objects in total (360 degrees). Regular sprayers will just coat the surfaces where the disinfectant happens to float down via gravity. With deadly viruses and antibiotic-resistant infections on the rise, and current processes and equipment only reaching about 25% of room surfaces, yesterday’s cleaning and infection control systems are obsolete.\nSTEP 3\nApplication of a Bio-shield that the EPA has proven to be effective for 90-days. Infectious materials cannot adhere to a surface or object coated with this polymer.\n\n## PROACTIVE INFECTION CONTROL\nQUARTERLY HIGH CONTACT SURFACE DISINFECTION SERVICE\nThis new world (with the advent of COVID-19) in which we find ourselves requires a shift in our decision-making paradigm. The thought process that went into designing our HCSDS involved giving our customers a way to take the battle to these dangerous viruses instead of just waiting for one to come along. By utilizing our quarterly HCSDS, you can finally be on the offense. The 90-day residual effect of our Bio-shield keeps infectious material from adhering to your surfaces and objects. Finally, you can be confident that you are being proactive in the protection of your staff and patrons. Clinical efficacy of infection prevention programs stems from a systematic, standardized approach eliminating the threats of today, and those emerging threats of tomorrow.\n# Fikes Infection Control, Inc. is THE STANDARD in INFECTION PREVENTION AND ELIMINATION!

Analyzing indoor environmental factors helps direct our efforts to assist clients in all health and safety endeavors. Results from indoor environmental inspection and testing can act as guideposts along the route to the safest, healthiest environment possible.\nG2 works with leading laboratories to provide reliable, high-quality indoor environmental testing services to a wide range of industrial companies, contractors, retailers, and public and government agencies.\nOur cutting-edge technology allows for many tests to be performed non-invasively and gives our clients immediate feedback.\n### Lead Testing Services\nLead is found in paint and materials in schools, businesses, homes and other public places. G2 uses the latest technological advancements to offer top-quality lead testing services.\nWe are one of the few environmental testing companies to use anx-ray fluorescence device (XRF) for lead testing\n. The XRF allows us to test for lead without cutting holes in walls or ceilings. It also produces immediate feedback. G2 experts provide quick, accurate lead testing results and then partner with clients to remediate any lead-related issues.\n### Mold Testing Services\nLong before you see mold on a wall or ceiling, it has had ample time to thrive and release spores into the air you breathe. One of the most concerning of the many mold types is\nStachybotrys chartarum\nor “black mold,” also referred to as “toxic mold.” It is a leading cause of chronic sinus infections, breathing problems and other allergy symptoms.\nMany times, mold cannot be seen while it lingers inside walls and around leaky pipes or air ducts, contaminating indoor air. G2 uses many tools during the course of a mold assessment, including thermal imaging and moisture meters, in order to show where moisture may be present in the building or home.\n### Radon Testing Services\nRadon is a naturally occurring chemical gas that leads to cancer and other health conditions when ingested or inhaled over time. Radon Act 51, passed by Congress, sets the natural outdoor level of radon gas (0.4 pCi/L) as the target radon level for indoor radon levels.\nAn alarming two-thirds of all homes exceed this target level. Because radon is tasteless and odorless, many people don’t suspect its presence.\nRadon testing is the only way to know if indoor radon levels exceed the recommended exposure limit. We offer professional radon testing and laboratory services so you can make informed decisions to keep people safe. We also provide objective documentation on the current radon levels in your business or school, which is useful for radon mitigation and building sales.\n### Asbestos Testing Services\nLong-term exposure to asbestos is linked to many negative health effects, including respiratory infections and cancer. Due to its presence in many buildings, it is important to test for asbestos. Asbestos testing is the only way to confirm an asbestos problem.\n### Water Testing Services\nClean water is essential to the health and safety of the people in your home, business, or school. Radon, lead, and many other chemicals can build up in the water without any indication of their presence. It is vitally important to test the water to find out what harmful contaminants may be present. The only way to know what dangerous chemicals are in your water is to test for them. G2 offers a range of water testing services to meet each client’s unique needs.\n### Chemical Testing\nChemicals are common in manufacturing industries and must be handled safely. Maintaining or achieving OSHA compliance is critical to workplace success and productivity. G2’s quick and accurate chemical testing services educate clients about chemicals in their workplace or product.\nG2 is experienced at providing testing that keeps people and products safe in all industries including pharmaceuticals, plastics and automotive equipment. Each client has specific testing needs for chemical contamination, trace chemicals, metals, and other chemical elements. G2 works closely with clients to create individualized testing processes.\n### Indoor Environmental Testing / Indoor Air Quality Testing\nThe term “Indoor Air Quality” (IAQ) characterizes the condition of the air inside a building.“Indoor Environmental Quality” (IEQ)\nis a broader term that describes occupant comfort in a built environment.\nIEQ goes further and includes sound, vibration, lighting and other variables that impact the comfort of building occupants.\nMany employee health complaints can be attributed to IEQ or IAQ problems. Symptoms such as headaches, severe fatigue, sinusitis, rhinitis, and asthma often appear while an employee is at work but dissipate when the employee leaves the building. This is known as “sick building syndrome” or “building-related illness.” Those suffering from sick building syndrome suspect but haven’t confirmed a specific cause for their symptoms. In building-related illnesses, a diagnosis is attributed directly to airborne building contaminants.\nG2 professionals are experts in testing indoor air quality and offering clients real solutions in a timely and cost-effective manner.\nOur goal at G2 is to help you provide a safe, clean and compliant work environment so that your employees are happy, healthy and productive\n.\nAllow G2 to be your “Go To” partner for all your environmental testing needs.\nOur clients have concerns such as selling their property, obtaining pre-approval for building permits, and the overall health of employees. They partner with our team of highly qualified environmental testing consultants and leading laboratories to receive the necessary information to make informed decisions and move forward with their business plans.\n## G2 Completes Risk Assessment at a Vancouver Industrial Coating Company\nWhile most companies endeavor to protect their employees from workplace hazards, it can be difficult to effectively do so without help from the experts.

Because of this, many building materials have been made from asbestos. When in good condition, materials containing asbestos don’t pose immediate harm. When the materials begin to break down, or show signs of ware, it is likely time to begin thinking about having your home, business or school tested for asbestos.\nPublic and commercial building owners should keep an inventory of asbestos-containing materials to inform workers, tenants, authorities and contractors.\n## Where might I find asbestos in the built environment?\nAsbestos can most commonly be found in buildings, but also in gas heaters, hair dryers, some clothing and automotive brakes.\nLook for cracks, dusty areas and spots where the material seems to be in the process of breaking down and falling apart. You may find asbestos in attic or wall insulation, vinyl flooring tiles, vinyl sheet flooring or adhesives and on certain roofing and siding shingles. It may also appear in textured paint and patching compounds used on the walls or ceilings, or on walls that surround wood burning stoves. Asbestos can also be found in hot water and steam pipe coatings and in oil and coal furnaces and door gaskets with insulation.\nAlthough these are common places for asbestos to be found in the built environment, there are many other places where this noncombustible material may have been used in your building or site.\n## Health Effects of Asbestos Exposure\nModern research has revealed the link between asbestos and certain types of cancer.\nHealth effects from long-term, unsafe asbestos exposure, is well documented. Asbestos fibers are easily inhaled and carried into the lower regions of the lungs where they can cause fibrotic lung disease (asbestosis) and changes in the lining of the chest cavity (pleura). Long-term inhalation of asbestos fibres also increases the risk of lung cancer and mesothelioma.\nOther health effects of asbestos exposure are respiratory infections and enlargement of the heart.\nPeople are more likely to experience asbestos-related disorders if they:\nare exposed to high concentrations of asbestos,\nare exposed for longer periods of time, and/or\nare exposed to asbestos more frequently.\n## Asbestos Testing\nAt G2 we offer\nasbestos testing services\nand carefully analyze samples to determine if our clients have asbestos in their building materials so that they can move forward with having it safely removed. G2 will professionally test for asbestos in your building, home or school. Once conclusive findings have been reported from our certified laboratories, we will provide you with the legal documentation and agency reporting you need for compliance and to begin mitigation.\n## Asbestos Control and PPE\nA control program is necessary when handling or using asbestos-containing material, and G2 can partner with you as you set up an asbestos control program. The overall goal of Asbestos Control is to safely remove the material without releasing the asbestos fibers.\nWorkers must wear the appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) clothing and respirator if the type of work they are doing involves asbestos. If workers require any PPE, employers should establish a PPE program which covers the selection, use and care of respirators and other PPE. G2 can help with PPE equipment and fittings to ensure safety for your employees.\nRespirators must be provided for workers working with or near asbestos. The respiratory equipment must be appropriate for the type of operation and the concentration of airborne asbestos.\nRespirators must be:\nProperly fitted to the worker.\nUsed and maintained according to written procedures established by the employer and are consistent with the manufacturer’s specifications.\nCleaned, disinfected and inspected after use on a regular basis.\nInspected and repaired before being used by a worker.\nStored in a convenient, clean and sanitary location when not in use.\nProtective clothing must be provided by the employer and should:\nBe made of a material that does not readily retain nor permit penetration of asbestos fibres.\nCover the head and body fully, fitting snugly at the ankles, wrists and neck in order to prevent asbestos fibres from reaching the garments and skin under the protective clothing.\nInclude suitable footwear.\nBe repaired or replaced if torn.\nContact us at if you suspect that your building is at risk of having asbestos orlead, mold and radon substances\nthat could be compromising your environment.
