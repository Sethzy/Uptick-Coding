Tom Anderson launched the company with a $2,500 loan and an ’82 Ford van, securing a partnership with Amerex to deliver essential services. By 1993, FPS hired its first employee and expanded its fleet, marking the start of a growing team.\n\nIn 1994, FPS added hood cleaning services and established its first shop in Barre Mills, WI, alongside a Fire Suppression Systems Division. Continued growth led to the launch of a Fire Alarm Division in 2000 and a move to a larger 10,000-square-foot facility in Bangor, WI, in 2004. FPS expanded further in 2018 with a second location in Eau Claire, WI, and in 2024, acquired a neighboring building in Bangor to create a dedicated space for its Hood Cleaning Division and a state-of-the-art conference room, transforming the site into a complete operational hub.\n\nOur skilled team of certified technicians and experienced project managers is committed to delivering tailored fire protection solutions with excellence and customer satisfaction.\n[Image: Fire Protection Specialists headquarters featuring our branded service vehicle.

Fire alarms are essential for safety and are often required by local fire codes for both residential and commercial properties. They provide early warnings, which can save lives and prevent significant property damage.\n### What types of fire alarm systems are available?\nConventional Systems: Ideal for smaller buildings, dividing the property into zones to locate potential fires.\nAddressable Systems: Perfect for larger properties, offering precise identification of fire locations.\nWireless Systems: Suitable for buildings where hardwiring is impractical.\nCombination Systems: Combine fire detection with smoke and carbon monoxide alarms for comprehensive safety.\n### How often should fire alarms be tested?\nFire alarms should be tested monthly for basic functionality. Annual inspections by certified technicians ensure all components are working properly and meet fire safety standards.\n### What does a fire alarm inspection include?\nAn inspection typically involves:\nTesting all detectors, sensors, and alarm devices.\nChecking battery life and backup power sources.\nVerifying the control panel and wiring connections.\nEnsuring compliance with current fire safety regulations.\n### How do I know if my fire alarm system needs an upgrade?\nYour system might need upgrading if it’s over 10–15 years old, frequently malfunctions, or doesn’t meet updated fire codes. A modern system ensures optimal performance and compliance.\n### Why is my fire alarm beeping or chirping?\nCommon reasons include:\nLow Battery: Replace the battery.\nSensor Malfunction: Consult a professional to repair or replace.\nEnd-of-Life Alarm: Alarms typically last 8–10 years.\n### Can I install a fire alarm system myself?\nBasic smoke detectors can be DIY-installed, but comprehensive fire alarm systems require professional installation to ensure proper setup and compliance with safety codes.\n### Do fire alarms require regular maintenance?\nYes. Maintenance includes:\nCleaning detectors to avoid dust buildup.\nReplacing batteries as needed.\nAnnual servicing by a professional technician to ensure reliability.\n## Fire Alarms and Central Monitoring\n## \n### How does central monitoring enhance a fire alarm system?\nCentral monitoring connects your fire alarm system to a 24/7 monitoring center.
