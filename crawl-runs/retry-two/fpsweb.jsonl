Tom Anderson launched the company with a $2,500 loan and an ’82 Ford van, securing a partnership with Amerex to deliver essential services. By 1993, FPS hired its first employee and expanded its fleet, marking the start of a growing team.\n​​\nIn 1994, FPS added hood cleaning services and established its first shop in Barre Mills, WI, alongside a Fire Suppression Systems Division. Continued growth led to the launch of a Fire Alarm Division in 2000 and a move to a larger 10,000-square-foot facility in Bangor, WI, in 2004. FPS expanded further in 2018 with a second location in Eau Claire, WI, and in 2024, acquired a neighboring building in Bangor to create a dedicated space for its Hood Cleaning Division and a state-of-the-art conference room, transforming the site into a complete operational hub.\n​\nOur skilled team of certified technicians and experienced project managers is committed to delivering tailored fire protection solutions with excellence and customer satisfaction.\n![Fire Protection Specialists headquarters featuring our branded service vehicle.

It uses sensors, detectors, and a control panel to trigger audible and visual alarms, providing critical time to evacuate and respond to emergencies.\n### ​\n### Do I need a fire alarm system in my home or business?\nYes. Fire alarms are essential for safety and are often required by local fire codes for both residential and commercial properties. They provide early warnings, which can save lives and prevent significant property damage.\n### What types of fire alarm systems are available?\n  * Conventional Systems: Ideal for smaller buildings, dividing the property into zones to locate potential fires.\n  * Addressable Systems: Perfect for larger properties, offering precise identification of fire locations.\n  * Wireless Systems: Suitable for buildings where hardwiring is impractical.\n  * Combination Systems: Combine fire detection with smoke and carbon monoxide alarms for comprehensive safety.\n\n\n### How often should fire alarms be tested?\nFire alarms should be tested monthly for basic functionality. Annual inspections by certified technicians ensure all components are working properly and meet fire safety standards.\n### What does a fire alarm inspection include?\nAn inspection typically involves:\n  * Testing all detectors, sensors, and alarm devices.\n  * Checking battery life and backup power sources.\n  * Verifying the control panel and wiring connections.\n  * Ensuring compliance with current fire safety regulations.\n\n\n### How do I know if my fire alarm system needs an upgrade?\nYour system might need upgrading if it’s over 10–15 years old, frequently malfunctions, or doesn’t meet updated fire codes. A modern system ensures optimal performance and compliance.\n### Why is my fire alarm beeping or chirping?\nCommon reasons include:\n  * Low Battery: Replace the battery.\n  * Sensor Malfunction: Consult a professional to repair or replace.\n  * End-of-Life Alarm: Alarms typically last 8–10 years.\n\n\n### Can I install a fire alarm system myself?\nBasic smoke detectors can be DIY-installed, but comprehensive fire alarm systems require professional installation to ensure proper setup and compliance with safety codes.\n### Do fire alarms require regular maintenance?\nYes. Maintenance includes:\n  * Cleaning detectors to avoid dust buildup.\n  * Replacing batteries as needed.\n  * Annual servicing by a professional technician to ensure reliability.\n\n\n## Fire Alarms and Central Monitoring\n## ​\n### How does central monitoring enhance a fire alarm system?\nCentral monitoring connects your fire alarm system to a 24/7 monitoring center. If an alarm is triggered, the system automatically alerts the monitoring center, which can contact emergency services for a faster response.\n### Do I need a landline for central monitoring?\nNo. Modern systems can use cellular or internet-based connections, providing reliable communication without requiring a landline.\n### What’s the difference between monitored and non-monitored fire alarms?\n  * Monitored Systems: Automatically alert emergency services through a monitoring center.\n  * Non-Monitored Systems: Trigger only audible alarms, requiring someone on-site to take action.\n\n\n### Can I upgrade my existing fire alarm system to include central monitoring?\nYes. Many modern fire alarm systems are compatible with central monitoring. We can assess your current system and recommend upgrades to integrate monitoring seamlessly.\n## Installation and Service FAQs\n### Do you install fire alarm systems?\nYes, we provide professional installation to ensure your property is protected and compliant with local fire codes.\n### How long does it take to install a fire alarm system?\nInstallation time depends on the size and complexity of your property. Smaller systems may take a single day, while larger or multi-zone systems may take several days.\n### Do you provide ongoing support and maintenance?\nYes.

It works by releasing a substance—such as water, foam, dry powder, or carbon dioxide—that interrupts the fire's chemical reaction, removing heat, oxygen, or fuel.\nHow many fire extinguishers do I need for my home or business?  \nFor homes, it’s recommended to have at least one fire extinguisher per floor, especially near the kitchen, garage, and any high-risk areas. Businesses should follow local fire codes, which often require fire extinguishers within 75 feet of travel distance in most environments.\nWhat are the different types of fire extinguishers, and what are they used for?\n  * Class A: For ordinary combustibles like wood, paper, and cloth.\n  * Class B: For flammable liquids like oil, grease, and gasoline.\n  * Class C: For electrical fires involving live equipment.\n  * Class D: For flammable metals like magnesium and titanium.\n  * Class K: For kitchen fires involving cooking oils and fats.\n\n\nHow do I know which fire extinguisher is right for me?\nThe type of extinguisher you need depends on the potential fire hazards in your space. For example, kitchens require a Class K extinguisher, while businesses with electrical equipment may need a Class C. We can help you choose the best option.\nWhere should I place fire extinguishers in my home or business?  \nPlace fire extinguishers in visible and easily accessible locations near high-risk areas, such as the kitchen, garage, or exit points. Businesses should comply with local fire codes for placement requirements.\n### Usage and Maintenance\nHow do I use a fire extinguisher?  \nFollow the PASS method:\n  * Pull the pin.\n  * Aim at the base of the fire.\n  * Squeeze the handle.\n  * Sweep side to side.\n\n\nWhat should I do if I accidentally discharge my fire extinguisher?  \nIf the extinguisher is partially discharged, it may need to be recharged.

Professional servicing includes testing, refilling, and verifying the extinguisher’s performance.\nHow do I know if my fire extinguisher needs recharging?  \nLook at the pressure gauge. If the needle is in the “red” zone, it needs recharging. Also, extinguishers that have been partially discharged must be refilled immediately.\nCan I refill or recharge a disposable fire extinguisher?  \nNo, disposable fire extinguishers cannot be recharged. They must be replaced after use or if they are expired.\nHow can I tell if my fire extinguisher has expired?  \nCheck the manufacturer’s date stamped on the label or cylinder. Most fire extinguishers have a lifespan of 5–15 years.

For businesses, training is often required by OSHA and other local regulations.\n​\nCan I use a fire extinguisher on any type of fire?  \nNo, using the wrong extinguisher can make a fire worse. For example, using water on an electrical or grease fire can spread flames. Always ensure you have the right extinguisher for the type of fire.\nWhen should I not use a fire extinguisher?\n  * When the fire is too large or spreading quickly.\n  * If you’re not sure which type of extinguisher to use.\n  * If your escape route is blocked.\n\n\nWhat should I do if a fire extinguisher doesn’t work during an emergency?  \nImmediately evacuate the area and call 911.

It works by releasing a substance—such as water, foam, dry powder, or carbon dioxide—that interrupts the fire's chemical reaction, removing heat, oxygen, or fuel.</p>\n\n<p><span>How many fire extinguishers do I need for my home or business?</span><br>\nFor homes, it’s recommended to have at least one fire extinguisher per floor, especially near the kitchen, garage, and any high-risk areas. Businesses should follow local fire codes, which often require fire extinguishers within 75 feet of travel distance in most environments.</p>\n\n<p><span>What are the different types of fire extinguishers, and what are they used for?</span></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Class A: For ordinary combustibles like wood, paper, and cloth.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Class B: For flammable liquids like oil, grease, and gasoline.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Class C: For electrical fires involving live equipment.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Class D: For flammable metals like magnesium and titanium.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Class K: For kitchen fires involving cooking oils and fats.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><span>How do I know which fire extinguisher is right for me?</span></p>\n\n<p>The type of extinguisher you need depends on the potential fire hazards in your space. For example, kitchens require a Class K extinguisher, while businesses with electrical equipment may need a Class C. We can help you choose the best option.</p>\n\n<p><span>Where should I place fire extinguishers in my home or business?</span><br>\nPlace fire extinguishers in visible and easily accessible locations near high-risk areas, such as the kitchen, garage, or exit points. Businesses should comply with local fire codes for placement requirements.</p>\n\n<h3><span><span><span>Usage and Maintenance</span></span></span></h3>\n\n<p><span>How do I use a fire extinguisher?</span><br>\nFollow the PASS method:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Pull the pin.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Aim at the base of the fire.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Squeeze the handle.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Sweep side to side.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><span>What should I do if I accidentally discharge my fire extinguisher?</span><br>\nIf the extinguisher is partially discharged, it may need to be recharged. Contact a professional service (like us!) to inspect, clean, and refill the extinguisher.</p>\n\n<p><span>How often should fire extinguishers be inspected or serviced?</span></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Monthly: Perform a visual inspection to check for damage, proper pressure, and accessibility.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Annually: Have a professional inspection to ensure compliance and functionality.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Every 6 Years: Internal maintenance is required for certain types.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><span>What is the difference between a visual inspection and a professional service?</span><br>\nA visual inspection involves checking the pressure gauge, seals, and overall condition. Professional servicing includes testing, refilling, and verifying the extinguisher’s performance.</p>\n\n<p><span>How do I know if my fire extinguisher needs recharging?</span><br>\nLook at the pressure gauge. If the needle is in the “red” zone, it needs recharging. Also, extinguishers that have been partially discharged must be refilled immediately.</p>\n\n<p><span>Can I refill or recharge a disposable fire extinguisher?</span><br>\nNo, disposable fire extinguishers cannot be recharged. They must be replaced after use or if they are expired.</p>\n\n<p><span>How can I tell if my fire extinguisher has expired?</span><br>\nCheck the manufacturer’s date stamped on the label or cylinder. Most fire extinguishers have a lifespan of 5–15 years. If it’s older than this or shows signs of damage, replace it.</p>\n\n<p><span>What is the lifespan of a fire extinguisher?</span><br>\nFire extinguishers typically last 5–15 years, depending on the type and maintenance. Regular inspections can help extend their life.</p>\n\n<h3><span><span><span>Regulations and Compliance</span></span></span></h3>\n\n<h3><span><span><span><span>​</span></span></span></span></h3>\n\n<p><span>What are the fire extinguisher requirements for businesses?</span><br>\nRequirements vary by location and industry, but generally, businesses must:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Have fire extinguishers within 75 feet of travel distance.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Use the correct extinguisher type for specific hazards.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Perform regular inspections and employee training.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><span>Are there laws about having fire extinguishers in vehicles or machinery?</span><br>\nYes, certain industries, like construction and transportation, require fire extinguishers in vehicles and heavy machinery. These must be readily accessible and properly maintained.</p>\n\n<p><span>Do I need a specific type of extinguisher for a commercial kitchen or restaurant?</span><br>\nYes, commercial kitchens require Class K fire extinguishers to combat fires caused by cooking oils and fats.</p>\n\n<h3><span><span><span>Training and Safety</span></span></span></h3>\n\n<p><span>​</span></p>\n\n<p><span>Do I need training to use a fire extinguisher?</span><br>\nWhile training isn’t legally required for homeowners, it’s highly recommended to know how to use one safely. For businesses, training is often required by OSHA and other local regulations.</p>\n\n<p><span><span>​</span></span></p>\n\n<p><span>Can I use a fire extinguisher on any type of fire?</span><br>\nNo, using the wrong extinguisher can make a fire worse. For example, using water on an electrical or grease fire can spread flames. Always ensure you have the right extinguisher for the type of fire.</p>\n\n<p><span>When should I not use a fire extinguisher?</span></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>When the fire is too large or spreading quickly.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you’re not sure which type of extinguisher to use.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If your escape route is blocked.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><span>What should I do if a fire extinguisher doesn’t work during an emergency?</span><br>\nImmediately evacuate the area and call 911. Never attempt to fight a fire with a faulty extinguisher.</p>\n\n<p><span>​</span></p>\n\n<h3><span><span><span>Disposal and Replacement</span></span></span></h3>\n\n<p><span>How do I dispose of an old or empty fire extinguisher?</span><br>\nContact your local waste disposal service or bring it to us. Never throw a fire extinguisher in the trash—it must be properly emptied and recycled.</p>\n\n<p><span>Can fire extinguishers be recycled?</span><br>\nYes, most fire extinguisher components, such as the metal cylinder, can be recycled once properly emptied.</p>\n\n<p><span>When should I replace my fire extinguisher instead of recharging it?</span><br>\nReplace it if:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>It’s damaged or corroded.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It’s expired.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It’s a disposable model.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><span><span><span>Mobile Services</span></span></span></h3>\n\n<h3><span><span><span><span>​</span></span></span></span></h3>\n\n<p><span>Do you offer on-site fire extinguisher inspections and recharging?</span><br>\nYes, our mobile service team can come to your location to inspect, recharge, or replace fire extinguishers.
