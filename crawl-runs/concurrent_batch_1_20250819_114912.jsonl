With rapid feedback cycles, we’ll craft the most satisfying journeys for your users.\n**Web and mobile app development services**. We follow the Agile methodology with short iterations, regular demos, and feedback collection.\n**Quality Assurance and Test Automation**. Our QA engineers ensure the product meets your requirements and has no defects.\n**Project Management** to ensure your product is delivered on time and within budget. Our managers have Project Management Institute (PMI) and Scrum Alliance certifications.\n**DevOps** to build robust automation together with cost-effective /and scalable infrastructure.\n * How much does web application development cost? What is the typical timeline? \nThe cost and timeline vary based on project complexity. \nThey range from $50,000 for a simple proof of concept to $200,000+ for complex enterprise systems. Our web app development agency provides transparent, customized quotes after understanding your requirements. For more information, check out our in-depth explainer on project costs.\nThe first version of a product typically takes 3–4 months to develop, depending on features, integrations, and testing needs. We then continue working with the client to improve and support the product long-term.\n * What sets MindK apart from other web development agencies? \nAs a product studio, we don’t simply create software. MindK dives deep into the client’s business, working side by side to achieve success. From market research to user testing, we ensure your customers remain happy while you grow the business.\n**14+ years of industry expertise**. MindK has built over 170 projects in Healthcare, E-learning, HR & Recruitment, Real Estate, and other industries.\n**Engineering excellence**. MindK employs 87% of Senior and Middle+ software engineers. Most of them began their careers at MindK, growing under the guidance of personal mentors. \n**MindK Product Development Framework (PDF)**. We use pre-built modules and customizable UI elements to save our clients up to 20% of the project’s costs and time.\n * What happens after I fill out the contact form? \n**NDA and intro consultation**\nWe’ll get back to you within 24 hours. Intro consultation aims to learn as much as possible about your business and user needs. With information at hand, we’ll gather a team of experts to analyze the request. Depending on your needs, we might propose a feasibility study or a discovery phase.\n**a) Free feasibility study**\nWe’ll run a few Q&A sessions with your team to elicit more requirements and prepare a rough project estimate. You can then sign a contract with MindK or choose another company.\n**b) Paid discovery phase**\nA deeper investigation usually takes 4 weeks. During this time, we’ll run product discovery workshops with experienced Product Managers, Solution Architects, and UI/UX experts. They’ll help you analyze the market and target users, identify hidden needs, and find optimal solutions to realize your vision. \nAs a result, you’ll get a design concept, solution architecture, a product roadmap with timeframes, and a detailed cost estimate. \n * What is your software development process? \nMindK follows the Scrum methodology. We break the project into smaller Sprints that last 2–4 weeks. Each one starts with a Sprint planning session together with the client representative. Together, we’ll define the Sprint goal, detail the requirements, and re-prioritize the features. \nThe team then starts writing and testing the code to complete the features by the end of the Sprint. You’ll have opportunities to visit daily meetings with developers in addition to regular status updates. Each Sprint ends with a live demo for the client with the ability to try out features. \nWe release the solution to a live environment as soon as you deem it ready. However, our services don’t end with the launch. We’ll continue improving and supporting your solution for as long as necessary.\n * How does MindK ensure security and compliance? \nSecurity is paramount for our web application development company. We use industry best practices, secure cloud services, and conduct regular security audits. Your application will comply with all relevant regulations, such as GDPR, CCPA/CPRA, HIPAA/NIST guidelines, and PCI DSS.\n * How do you ensure high software quality? \n**Comprehensive requirements analysis**\nQuality starts before the development phase. We collaborate closely with the client to understand their business goals, user needs, functional, and non-functional requirements. \nThis phase is crucial in clearly understanding project goals and creating effective test cases. We collaborate with stakeholders to ensure comprehensive testing coverage from the very start.\n**QA and test automation**\nOur web development agency integrates testing into the SDLC. Early detection and resolution of defects reduces costs by addressing issues before they escalate.\nWe use automation whenever possible, aiming for efficiency, repeatability, and scalability. MindK goes beyond traditional test automation with UI End-to-End (E2E) and API testing. We accelerate QA and reduce manual effort with the right tools and frameworks. Speeding up feedback cycles and increasing coverage provides more robust and reliable software.\n**Non-functional testing**\nClient-side and server-side performance testing guarantees optimal functionality under varying loads. We identify and address potential bottlenecks and enhance the overall performance of your software.\nUser experience testing is a key factor in the success of any software. It ensures that your application provides an intuitive and enjoyable experience for end-users.\n**User acceptance testing (UAT)**\nEnsuring that your software meets end user expectations is paramount. We involve end-users in the testing process to obtain valuable feedback for refinement purposes. We address identified issues promptly, emphasizing the importance of delivering a polished, user-friendly product.\n * Do you provide ongoing support? \nYes. Our web app development services don’t end with the launch. We’ll continue with long-term support and maintenance.

They use strong authorization, authentication, and security policies.\nComposite APIs\nallow engineers to bundle requests to several different APIs. This cuts down the total number of interfaces.\nYou can also group APIs depending on the protocols used, including REST, SOAP, GraphQL, gRPC, and more. You can learn more in our\ndetailed article on APIs\n.\nHow much does it cost to develop an API?\nAPI development costs vary from $10,000 to $50,000. Such a wide range is explained by multiple factors that affect the costs. They include the project complexity, API type, quantity of endpoints, technologies and protocols used, and non-functional requirements like security. You can\nshare the project details\nwith MindK to get a more precise quote.\nHow long will it take to build my API?\nAPI development time varies based on many factors. They include the number of endpoints, integrations, team experience, and non-functional requirements. For large, complex APIs, the entire process takes anywhere from 6 months to over a year. We can accelerate this timeline with Agile methodologies and modern API development frameworks.\nWhat engagement models do you offer as an API development company?\nOur\nengagement models\ninclude fixed-price contracts for projects with well-defined requirements. We also offer time and material billing for projects where requirements tend to change over time.\nHow do you ensure that my API is secure?\nMindK follows the latest best practices for API security. Using Amazon Web Services (AWS) gives us access to a lot of helpful services for Web Application Firewalls (WAF), application & infrastructure access control, system monitoring & alerting, and more. We use the platform’s recommended architecture, as well as encrypt the data in transit and at rest if necessary.\nWhat factors should I consider when choosing an API development company?\nBefore you\nhire an API developer\n, consider factors such as the provider’s expertise, experience, and track record. Also, assess their ability to work with your existing systems and provide ongoing support and maintenance.\nHow do I integrate an API into my existing applications?\nThe\nintegration process\nwill depend on the specific API and applications you are working with. Typically, you’ll need to get an API key or access token, which allows your application to authenticate and communicate with the API. You then need to write code into your application that uses the API to access data or functionality.\n## Our approach\n\nWhat is an API in Software Development?

What's the potential ROI?\nTypical healthcare software modernization projects range from $100K to $1M+. The exact sum depends on complexity and scale, regulatory requirements, and the level of architecture changes:\nSmall system modernization costs $100K-$250K.\nMedium complexity (EHR integrations, mid-sized) cost $250K-$750K.\nLarge, enterprise healthcare systems cost $750K-$1M+.\nMost healthcare organizations realize positive ROI within 12-24 months. This includes direct cost savings from reduced maintenance and downtime, improved productivity, reduced compliance risk, and regulatory penalties.\nWhat is the expected downtime?\nMindK uses a phased implementation approach. Careful planning and contingency rollback keep downtime to less than 24 hours. Parallel deployments can achieve near-zero downtime.\nWhat are the risks of healthcare software modernization?\nCommon risks include downtime, potential data loss, budget overruns, and regulatory penalties.\nTo minimize these risks, MindK uses phased deployments, robust rollback strategies, thorough pre-launch testing, data validation and backup, regular cost tracking, and compliance-by-design software modernization.\nWhat are the benefits of application modernization? How will it impact my business?\nHealthcare application modernization services\ncan provide multiple benefits:\nImproved interoperability & integration (FHIR/HL7), enabling seamless clinical workflows.\nReduced clinician burnout due to intuitive, streamlined user interfaces and clinical decision support.\nIncreased security and regulatory compliance (HIPAA, FDA, CMS Interoperability rules).\nCost reductions from automated processes, reduced downtime, and lower maintenance overhead.\nEnhanced patient experience and clinical outcomes through responsive, reliable applications.\nWhat are the 5 R's of application modernization?\nThe\n5 R’s framework\ndescribes modernization strategies:\nRehost\n: lift and shift legacy apps directly to cloud infrastructure with minimal changes.\nRefactor\n: restructure code to optimize existing features and improve performance without major functionality changes.\nRe-architect\n: transform the application structure significantly, e.g., monolith to microservices or serverless architecture.\nRebuild\n: completely redevelop the application from scratch, leveraging modern technologies.\nReplace\n: fully retire legacy software, replacing it entirely with new solutions or commercial SaaS alternatives.\nHealthcare typically favors the Refactor, Re-architect, or Rebuild approaches for compliance and interoperability advantages.\n### Modernize your healthcare software\nLet us know about your technology challenges.

Students will be required to complete a very thorough Participation Agreement and Release of Liability prior to participation in any training. Minors are not permitted to attend any Tactical Consultants training unless previously scheduled as a private, 1/1 training with the student and parent or guardian present at all times. Students will need to review and have a working knowledge of the **Cardinal Safety Rules.** There are course prerequisites: Pistol Phase 1 is a prereq for Phase 2 pistol and AR-15 Phase 1 is a prereq for Phase 2 AR-15. There is no prereq for Concealed Carry and Home Defense, Intro to Handgun, Intro to AR-15, or Shotgun.\n##### What gear do I need for class? \nEach class has its own gear list. You can see what is needed in the Required Equipment section on each class page.\n##### What time do we start class?\nUnless notified of a different time slot, all full and half-day training starts at 8 am sharp.\n##### What if I don’t have a firearm?\nFor any class, it is highly recommended that you come to training with the firearm you use to defend your life so you become proficient with that gun. However, rental pistols are available for training if needed. AR-15s and Shotguns are only available for rent during private, 1/1 training.\n##### Can I purchase ammunition?\nTactical Consultants sells ammunition for class but due to unforeseen ammunition shortages that come and go, please arrange this prior to your training date so that it can be made available.\n##### Should I bring lunch/snacks? \nYes, for full days you will need to bring lunch, some snacks, and a full water bottle or two. During half-day training events, you will still need some snacks for fuel and plenty of water.\n##### I enrolled and paid for a class, can I get a refund?\nAll training sales are final, there are no refunds given. Other students have waited for training when enrolled students cancel last minute or are no-shows. It is unfair to those students. Please do not sign up for a class if you believe there is a possibility you may cancel.\n##### When attending a rifle class, should I have my rifle setup complete and zeroed?\nYes, please have your rifle set up the way you want to train with it and have it zeroed for a 50/200 yard zero, other zero distances are acceptable and we can help fine-tune your zero during the first hour of training.\n##### What are Tactical Consultants Cardinal Rules?\n**1. Always treat every firearm as if it were loaded.** Over the many years of working in firearm instruction, both with law enforcement personnel and private citizens, I must shake my head at the many accidents that occur and are labeled “negligent” or “accidental” discharges. These accidents occur, many resulting in death or grave bodily harm because the people handling the firearm are treating it as an everyday object, rather than a tool, capable of taking a human life. Once we place human intervention into the equation, these avoidable accidents occur with what should be an otherwise inert object. During my firearms instruction and while discussing the universal safety rules, I advise my students to not only treat every firearm as if it were loaded but more importantly, ALWAYS KNOW THE STATUS OF YOUR WEAPON! In other words, is your firearm ready to help protect you when it matters the most, at a second’s notice? A loaded weapon is not an unsafe weapon. It’s the individual handling the weapon that creates the unsafe situation. I always conduct press checks to confirm the status of a LOADED weapon. I am already considering the weapon loaded for the purpose of providing a safe environment for myself and the people around me, however, it’s the confirmation that I actually loaded it with a round in the chamber prior to holstering and trusting that weapon with my life when headed out for the day. This was drilled into me as a young police officer. Assuming the gun is loaded when finding yourself in a life-or-death incident, and a round is not chambered, well, that won’t fare well for your response to the critical incident you’re faced with.\n**2. Always point your firearm in a safe direction unless defending yourself or others.** Pointing your firearm at an assailant may be the safest direction! Making the statement, “do not point your firearm at anything you're not willing to shoot, kill or destroy,” is not an accurate statement in my opinion. There are common situations where we will point our firearms in directions or at something “we do not wish to destroy.” With this universal safety rule, many instructors will use the laser rule, and I think that is a good way of conceptualizing the muzzle or barrel end of your firearm. With an imaginary laser shooting out from the end of your barrel, you want to prevent that laser from crossing paths with you or anyone else. A question you should ask yourself is when would the laser be “OFF,” where you may be able to point that weapon at yourself or a part of your body? Usually students will respond, it’s always ON. However, what about when a holstered pistol is on your hip or carried in the appendix position? The muzzle will be aiming directly at your hip, legs, calves, or feet. So, we can say that a properly holstered weapon’s laser is OFF until a person interacts with that weapon. My safety on a weapon is my self-discipline, training, and the holster that safely covers the entire trigger. In life, if something is about to drop to the ground such as a cell phone, or a valuable fragile item, our natural response is to attempt to catch it and prevent it from striking the ground. However, that is exactly what we don’t want to do with a gun. A weapon slipping from your grip, holster or otherwise, is out of control and the barrel is flying around pointing in multiple unsafe directions. So let it go. Attempting to catch it and inadvertently pressing the trigger is likely to happen and we want to avoid that at all costs. Most modern weapons of today are very safe and can take a considerable drop without discharging a round.\n**3. Always keep your finger off the trigger and high up on the frame until you are ready to fire.** My first safety on a weapon is my trigger finger. My second, and stated above in rule #2, my holster is my external safety on my weapon. In my opinion, external safeties on every day carry firearms can present a problem for most people that fail to train and train frequently. In a high stress self-defense incident, you are not going to be thinking about disengaging a safety on a pistol. So having your trigger finger positioned high on the frame or slide is the best place, not along the trigger guard where I was taught during my law enforcement career. A sympathetic response and flinch can cause that trigger finger to retract and pull back into where your hand is making a fist, causing your index finger to press the trigger.\n**4. Always be sure of your target and what is beyond.** Also, be aware of your entire surrounding area! Not just the backstop. This is the embodiment of situational awareness in a gunfight. Be sure of what is also left and right, as you must be paying attention to your entire surroundings. The ABSOLUTE APPLICATION OF SITUATIONAL AWARENESS. Like wolves, criminals will usually travel in packs and they typically don’t operate alone. At the very least, that is what we should be aware of and ready for. There may be additional threats to engage, including assaults, drug violence, robberies, home invasions, etc. In any violent encounter, expect the assailants to be accompanied by another criminal or co-defendant. You may need to transition to the next target or threat level and continue to defend yourself and your loved ones. This rule is the absolute application of situational awareness while manipulating your firearm, by not only paying attention to the backstop but to your ENTIRE SURROUNDING. So, the ultimate goal at the end of the day is to survive and go home alive, not only for yourself but more importantly, for your loved ones.\n**5. Be attentive and careful all the time.**\n**6. If you see a dangerous situation, report it to a range instructor directly.**\n**7. Absolutely no use of drugs or alcohol.** Instructors must be made aware of clients' use of prescription drugs that may cause a safety hazard.\n## Ready to Get Started?\nTraining & Classes\nContact Us\nRecaptcha requires verification. \n- \nprotected by **reCAPTCHA**\n-\n\n### [PAGE] https://tactical-consultants.com/about\nWelcome to Tactical Consultants\n## About Us\n## Tactical Consultants\n### A Strong Start\nDamon Smith is the owner/founder and head instructor of Tactical Consultants LLC firearms sales and training facility. Damon was fortunate to grow up around firearms with his father and it wasn’t uncommon to have those firearms accessible to him as he grew up. His father taught him well about firearms safety, eliminated the “curiosity” guns seem to have with children and taught him an overall strong level of respect for the firearms in their household. Damon grew up shooting at gun ranges with his family and hunting with his Dad. At a very young age, his father taught him how to reload ammunition, and by age 15 Damon had a complete ammunition reloading station in his bedroom making various ammunition calibers from rifle to handgun!\n### Experienced in Training Others\nEarly in his twenties, Damon became a police officer where he served 20 years with various agencies and the Federal Government. He became an instructor/trainer very early in his career as a Field Training Officer teaching new police officers on road patrol. Damon also served as an Operator and Scout on a Mutual Aid SWAT/HRT team, tasked to service many cities for high-risk search warrants, barricaded gunmen, hostage rescue, and other incidents they would be called upon. Not long after, he was promoted to a firearms instructor and served for many years teaching in his agency’s firearms training division. This division not only taught police officers at the live fire range but also worked with officers in patrol operations, scenarios and simunition training. Damon was then asked to take over the AR-15/Patrol Rifle training for the department where he completely redesigned the course curriculum to teach both new and veteran officers how to implement the rifle on everyday patrol.\n### Transition to Civilian Sector\nHis police department started offering concealed pistol training classes for Judges, employees, friends, family, and retired police officers, certified under the Michigan Commission on Law Enforcement Standards. This is where he started transitioning to teaching the citizen side of firearms training and helped to certify many people in earning their concealed pistol licenses. Damon is also a certified concealed pistol and home defense instructor with the USCCA/United States Concealed Carry Association. Damon completed his Law Enforcement career as a Detective serving in his agency’s Bureau of Investigations.\n### Real World Experience Now Available to You\nDamon has been very passionate and serious about his training and being the best possible instructor with his fellow police officers, so they had every possible advantage to survive and go home to their families at the end of their shift. Now, Damon hopes to share this same passion and drive to help others exercise their 2nd Amendment right to confidently carry a firearm for the protection of themselves and their loved ones.\n\n## Ready to Get Started?\nTraining & Classes\nContact Us\n\n### [PAGE] https://tactical-consultants.com/firearms-for-sale\nWelcome to Tactical Consultants\n## Firearms for Sale\nIn addition to Tactical Consultants training programs, we are also a full service Federally Licensed Dealer.\nFor in stock inventory, we only carry EDC (every day carry) firearms that we truly believe in and trust with our own lives.

Students will be required to complete a very thorough Participation Agreement and Release of Liability prior to participation in any training. Minors are not permitted to attend any Tactical Consultants training unless previously scheduled as a private, 1/1 training with the student and parent or guardian present at all times. Students will need to review and have a working knowledge of theCardinal Safety Rules\n.\nThere are course prerequisites: Pistol Phase 1 is a prereq for Phase 2 pistol and AR-15 Phase 1 is a prereq for Phase 2 AR-15. There is no prereq for Concealed Carry and Home Defense, Intro to Handgun, Intro to AR-15, or Shotgun.\n##### What gear do I need for class?\nEach class has its own gear list. You can see what is needed in the Required Equipment section on each class page.\n##### What time do we start class?\nUnless notified of a different time slot, all full and half-day training starts at 8 am sharp.\n##### What if I don’t have a firearm?\nFor any class, it is highly recommended that you come to training with the firearm you use to defend your life so you become proficient with that gun. However, rental pistols are available for training if needed. AR-15s and Shotguns are only available for rent during private, 1/1 training.\n##### Can I purchase ammunition?\nTactical Consultants sells ammunition for class but due to unforeseen ammunition shortages that come and go, please arrange this prior to your training date so that it can be made available.\n##### Should I bring lunch/snacks?\nYes, for full days you will need to bring lunch, some snacks, and a full water bottle or two. During half-day training events, you will still need some snacks for fuel and plenty of water.\n##### I enrolled and paid for a class, can I get a refund?\nAll training sales are final, there are no refunds given. Other students have waited for training when enrolled students cancel last minute or are no-shows. It is unfair to those students. Please do not sign up for a class if you believe there is a possibility you may cancel.\n##### When attending a rifle class, should I have my rifle setup complete and zeroed?\nYes, please have your rifle set up the way you want to train with it and have it zeroed for a 50/200 yard zero, other zero distances are acceptable and we can help fine-tune your zero during the first hour of training.\n##### What are Tactical Consultants Cardinal Rules?\n1. Always treat every firearm as if it were loaded.\nOver the many years of working in firearm instruction, both with law enforcement personnel and private citizens, I must shake my head at the many accidents that occur and are labeled “negligent” or “accidental” discharges. These accidents occur, many resulting in death or grave bodily harm because the people handling the firearm are treating it as an everyday object, rather than a tool, capable of taking a human life. Once we place human intervention into the equation, these avoidable accidents occur with what should be an otherwise inert object. During my firearms instruction and while discussing the universal safety rules, I advise my students to not only treat every firearm as if it were loaded but more importantly, ALWAYS KNOW THE STATUS OF YOUR WEAPON! In other words, is your firearm ready to help protect you when it matters the most, at a second’s notice? A loaded weapon is not an unsafe weapon. It’s the individual handling the weapon that creates the unsafe situation. I always conduct press checks to confirm the status of a LOADED weapon. I am already considering the weapon loaded for the purpose of providing a safe environment for myself and the people around me, however, it’s the confirmation that I actually loaded it with a round in the chamber prior to holstering and trusting that weapon with my life when headed out for the day. This was drilled into me as a young police officer. Assuming the gun is loaded when finding yourself in a life-or-death incident, and a round is not chambered, well, that won’t fare well for your response to the critical incident you’re faced with.\n2. Always point your firearm in a safe direction unless defending yourself or others.\nPointing your firearm at an assailant may be the safest direction! Making the statement, “do not point your firearm at anything you're not willing to shoot, kill or destroy,” is not an accurate statement in my opinion. There are common situations where we will point our firearms in directions or at something “we do not wish to destroy.” With this universal safety rule, many instructors will use the laser rule, and I think that is a good way of conceptualizing the muzzle or barrel end of your firearm. With an imaginary laser shooting out from the end of your barrel, you want to prevent that laser from crossing paths with you or anyone else.

A weapon slipping from your grip, holster or otherwise, is out of control and the barrel is flying around pointing in multiple unsafe directions. So let it go. Attempting to catch it and inadvertently pressing the trigger is likely to happen and we want to avoid that at all costs. Most modern weapons of today are very safe and can take a considerable drop without discharging a round.\n3. Always keep your finger off the trigger and high up on the frame until you are ready to fire.\nMy first safety on a weapon is my trigger finger. My second, and stated above in rule #2, my holster is my external safety on my weapon. In my opinion, external safeties on every day carry firearms can present a problem for most people that fail to train and train frequently. In a high stress self-defense incident, you are not going to be thinking about disengaging a safety on a pistol. So having your trigger finger positioned high on the frame or slide is the best place, not along the trigger guard where I was taught during my law enforcement career. A sympathetic response and flinch can cause that trigger finger to retract and pull back into where your hand is making a fist, causing your index finger to press the trigger.\n4.
