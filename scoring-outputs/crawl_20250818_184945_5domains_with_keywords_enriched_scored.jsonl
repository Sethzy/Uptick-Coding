With rapid feedback cycles, we’ll craft the most satisfying journeys for your users.\n**Web and mobile app development services**. We follow the Agile methodology with short iterations, regular demos, and feedback collection.\n**Quality Assurance and Test Automation**. Our QA engineers ensure the product meets your requirements and has no defects.\n**Project Management** to ensure your product is delivered on time and within budget. Our managers have Project Management Institute (PMI) and Scrum Alliance certifications.\n**DevOps** to build robust automation together with cost-effective /and scalable infrastructure.\n * How much does web application development cost? What is the typical timeline? \nThe cost and timeline vary based on project complexity. \nThey range from $50,000 for a simple proof of concept to $200,000+ for complex enterprise systems. Our web app development agency provides transparent, customized quotes after understanding your requirements. For more information, check out our in-depth explainer on project costs.\nThe first version of a product typically takes 3–4 months to develop, depending on features, integrations, and testing needs. We then continue working with the client to improve and support the product long-term.\n * What sets MindK apart from other web development agencies? \nAs a product studio, we don’t simply create software. MindK dives deep into the client’s business, working side by side to achieve success. From market research to user testing, we ensure your customers remain happy while you grow the business.\n**14+ years of industry expertise**. MindK has built over 170 projects in Healthcare, E-learning, HR & Recruitment, Real Estate, and other industries.\n**Engineering excellence**. MindK employs 87% of Senior and Middle+ software engineers. Most of them began their careers at MindK, growing under the guidance of personal mentors. \n**MindK Product Development Framework (PDF)**. We use pre-built modules and customizable UI elements to save our clients up to 20% of the project’s costs and time.\n * What happens after I fill out the contact form? \n**NDA and intro consultation**\nWe’ll get back to you within 24 hours. Intro consultation aims to learn as much as possible about your business and user needs. With information at hand, we’ll gather a team of experts to analyze the request. Depending on your needs, we might propose a feasibility study or a discovery phase.\n**a) Free feasibility study**\nWe’ll run a few Q&A sessions with your team to elicit more requirements and prepare a rough project estimate. You can then sign a contract with MindK or choose another company.\n**b) Paid discovery phase**\nA deeper investigation usually takes 4 weeks. During this time, we’ll run product discovery workshops with experienced Product Managers, Solution Architects, and UI/UX experts. They’ll help you analyze the market and target users, identify hidden needs, and find optimal solutions to realize your vision. \nAs a result, you’ll get a design concept, solution architecture, a product roadmap with timeframes, and a detailed cost estimate. \n * What is your software development process? \nMindK follows the Scrum methodology. We break the project into smaller Sprints that last 2–4 weeks. Each one starts with a Sprint planning session together with the client representative. Together, we’ll define the Sprint goal, detail the requirements, and re-prioritize the features. \nThe team then starts writing and testing the code to complete the features by the end of the Sprint. You’ll have opportunities to visit daily meetings with developers in addition to regular status updates. Each Sprint ends with a live demo for the client with the ability to try out features. \nWe release the solution to a live environment as soon as you deem it ready. However, our services don’t end with the launch. We’ll continue improving and supporting your solution for as long as necessary.\n * How does MindK ensure security and compliance? \nSecurity is paramount for our web application development company. We use industry best practices, secure cloud services, and conduct regular security audits. Your application will comply with all relevant regulations, such as GDPR, CCPA/CPRA, HIPAA/NIST guidelines, and PCI DSS.\n * How do you ensure high software quality? \n**Comprehensive requirements analysis**\nQuality starts before the development phase. We collaborate closely with the client to understand their business goals, user needs, functional, and non-functional requirements. \nThis phase is crucial in clearly understanding project goals and creating effective test cases. We collaborate with stakeholders to ensure comprehensive testing coverage from the very start.\n**QA and test automation**\nOur web development agency integrates testing into the SDLC. Early detection and resolution of defects reduces costs by addressing issues before they escalate.\nWe use automation whenever possible, aiming for efficiency, repeatability, and scalability. MindK goes beyond traditional test automation with UI End-to-End (E2E) and API testing. We accelerate QA and reduce manual effort with the right tools and frameworks. Speeding up feedback cycles and increasing coverage provides more robust and reliable software.\n**Non-functional testing**\nClient-side and server-side performance testing guarantees optimal functionality under varying loads. We identify and address potential bottlenecks and enhance the overall performance of your software.\nUser experience testing is a key factor in the success of any software. It ensures that your application provides an intuitive and enjoyable experience for end-users.\n**User acceptance testing (UAT)**\nEnsuring that your software meets end user expectations is paramount. We involve end-users in the testing process to obtain valuable feedback for refinement purposes. We address identified issues promptly, emphasizing the importance of delivering a polished, user-friendly product.\n * Do you provide ongoing support? \nYes. Our web app development services don’t end with the launch. We’ll continue with long-term support and maintenance.

They use strong authorization, authentication, and security policies.\nComposite APIs\nallow engineers to bundle requests to several different APIs. This cuts down the total number of interfaces.\nYou can also group APIs depending on the protocols used, including REST, SOAP, GraphQL, gRPC, and more. You can learn more in our\ndetailed article on APIs\n.\nHow much does it cost to develop an API?\nAPI development costs vary from $10,000 to $50,000. Such a wide range is explained by multiple factors that affect the costs. They include the project complexity, API type, quantity of endpoints, technologies and protocols used, and non-functional requirements like security. You can\nshare the project details\nwith MindK to get a more precise quote.\nHow long will it take to build my API?\nAPI development time varies based on many factors. They include the number of endpoints, integrations, team experience, and non-functional requirements. For large, complex APIs, the entire process takes anywhere from 6 months to over a year. We can accelerate this timeline with Agile methodologies and modern API development frameworks.\nWhat engagement models do you offer as an API development company?\nOur\nengagement models\ninclude fixed-price contracts for projects with well-defined requirements. We also offer time and material billing for projects where requirements tend to change over time.\nHow do you ensure that my API is secure?\nMindK follows the latest best practices for API security. Using Amazon Web Services (AWS) gives us access to a lot of helpful services for Web Application Firewalls (WAF), application & infrastructure access control, system monitoring & alerting, and more. We use the platform’s recommended architecture, as well as encrypt the data in transit and at rest if necessary.\nWhat factors should I consider when choosing an API development company?\nBefore you\nhire an API developer\n, consider factors such as the provider’s expertise, experience, and track record. Also, assess their ability to work with your existing systems and provide ongoing support and maintenance.\nHow do I integrate an API into my existing applications?\nThe\nintegration process\nwill depend on the specific API and applications you are working with. Typically, you’ll need to get an API key or access token, which allows your application to authenticate and communicate with the API. You then need to write code into your application that uses the API to access data or functionality.\n## Our approach\n\nWhat is an API in Software Development?

What's the potential ROI?\nTypical healthcare software modernization projects range from $100K to $1M+. The exact sum depends on complexity and scale, regulatory requirements, and the level of architecture changes:\nSmall system modernization costs $100K-$250K.\nMedium complexity (EHR integrations, mid-sized) cost $250K-$750K.\nLarge, enterprise healthcare systems cost $750K-$1M+.\nMost healthcare organizations realize positive ROI within 12-24 months. This includes direct cost savings from reduced maintenance and downtime, improved productivity, reduced compliance risk, and regulatory penalties.\nWhat is the expected downtime?\nMindK uses a phased implementation approach. Careful planning and contingency rollback keep downtime to less than 24 hours. Parallel deployments can achieve near-zero downtime.\nWhat are the risks of healthcare software modernization?\nCommon risks include downtime, potential data loss, budget overruns, and regulatory penalties.\nTo minimize these risks, MindK uses phased deployments, robust rollback strategies, thorough pre-launch testing, data validation and backup, regular cost tracking, and compliance-by-design software modernization.\nWhat are the benefits of application modernization? How will it impact my business?\nHealthcare application modernization services\ncan provide multiple benefits:\nImproved interoperability & integration (FHIR/HL7), enabling seamless clinical workflows.\nReduced clinician burnout due to intuitive, streamlined user interfaces and clinical decision support.\nIncreased security and regulatory compliance (HIPAA, FDA, CMS Interoperability rules).\nCost reductions from automated processes, reduced downtime, and lower maintenance overhead.\nEnhanced patient experience and clinical outcomes through responsive, reliable applications.\nWhat are the 5 R's of application modernization?\nThe\n5 R’s framework\ndescribes modernization strategies:\nRehost\n: lift and shift legacy apps directly to cloud infrastructure with minimal changes.\nRefactor\n: restructure code to optimize existing features and improve performance without major functionality changes.\nRe-architect\n: transform the application structure significantly, e.g., monolith to microservices or serverless architecture.\nRebuild\n: completely redevelop the application from scratch, leveraging modern technologies.\nReplace\n: fully retire legacy software, replacing it entirely with new solutions or commercial SaaS alternatives.\nHealthcare typically favors the Refactor, Re-architect, or Rebuild approaches for compliance and interoperability advantages.\n### Modernize your healthcare software\nLet us know about your technology challenges.
