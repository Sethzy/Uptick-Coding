Contact our sales team for more information.\n * #### Inspections \nWe offer yearly fire extinguisher inspections based on NFPA 10 at a competitive price. We look for any needed services and ensure the extinguisher has the right labels, pressure, and is properly mounted according to NFPA 10 rules.\n * #### Hydrostatic Tests & 6YR Maintenance \nWe offer 12-year hydrostatic testing for ABC extinguishers as well as 5-year hydrostatic testing for CO2 and water-based extinguishers. We also offer 6-year maintenance and recharges for extinguisher types that require maintenance. \n * #### New Extinguishers \nBFP can provide new extinguishers and installation of them as well. We follow NFPA 10 guidelines to meet compliance regulations.\n\nIcon of a fire extinguisher spraying water on a flame\n## What is involved with an NFPA 10 fire extinguisher inspection?\nAn NFPA 10 annual fire extinguisher inspection is crucial for ensuring fire safety in any facility. This comprehensive evaluation guarantees that your fire extinguishers are functional, compliant, and ready to operate in case of an emergency. Here’s what customers can expect during the inspection process.\n#### Inspection Process Overview\n 1. **Visual Inspection** : Inspectors will assess the overall condition of each fire extinguisher, looking for signs of damage, corrosion, or tampering. They will check that the extinguisher is mounted securely and accessible in case of an emergency.\n 2. **Pressure Check** : The pressure gauge will be inspected to ensure it falls within the acceptable range. Extinguishers with low pressure may not function effectively when needed.\n 3. **Physical Condition** : Technicians will examine the nozzle, hose, and other mechanical components for obstructions or deterioration. An unobstructed nozzle is vital for effective fire suppression.\n 4. **Labeling and Instruction Check** : Inspectors will verify that each extinguisher has clear, readable labels and instructions. These should be easily visible to anyone who may need to use the extinguisher.\n 5. **Maintenance Tag Review** : The inspector will check the maintenance tags on each extinguisher to ensure they are up to date with inspections.\n 6. **Annual Documentation** : After the inspection, customers will receive a detailed report that outlines the condition of each extinguisher, any issues found, and recommendations for corrective actions. This documentation is essential for compliance and record-keeping. The extinguisher will receive a current tag with the type of extinguisher, the year (hole-punched), etc. BFP does not tag fire extinguishers that have found deficiencies. \n\n#### Why Choose Us for Your Inspection\nAt Bighorn Fire Protection, we pride ourselves on our commitment to safety and professionalism. Our trained technicians follow NFPA standards meticulously, providing you with the peace of mind that your fire extinguishers are in top condition. Conducting regular inspections not only ensures compliance with local fire codes but also enhances the safety of your facility’s occupants. Choose Bighorn Fire Protection for an expert inspection and experience the assurance that comes from knowing your fire safety equipment is reliable when it matters most.\n## The Different Types of Extinguishers\nWall-mounted fire extinguisher in a metal case with a glass front, set against a red and beige wall.\n#### ABC \nABC extinguishers are designed to effectively combat a variety of fire hazards, specifically targeting Type A hazards, Type B hazards, and Type C hazards. \nThis versatility is precisely why they are commonly referred to as \"ABC Extinguishers.\" These extinguishers provide a comprehensive solution for fire emergencies, ensuring that both solid, liquid, and gas-based fires can be safely addressed.\nABC extinguishers contain a dry chemical agent, typically composed of monoammonium phosphate, which is effective for extinguishing fires classified as A (ordinary combustibles), B (flammable liquids), and C (electrical fires). \nThis multipurpose agent works by interrupting the chemical reaction of the fire triangle and effectively suppresses flames across various fire types.\nRed carbon dioxide fire extinguisher with instructions on the label.\n#### CO2 \nCO2 extinguishers, or carbon dioxide extinguishers, are utilized primarily for fighting Class B (liquid) and Class C (electrical) fires. Their effectiveness lies in their ability to displace oxygen in the area of the fire, thereby suffocating the flames.\nThe contents of a CO2 extinguisher comprise carbon dioxide gas, which is stored under pressure in a cylinder. When activated, a nozzle directs the gas toward the fire. CO2 is non-conductive, making it suitable for use in environments where electrical equipment is present, such as server rooms and electrical panels.\nOne significant advantage of CO2 extinguishers is that they leave no residue after use, making them ideal for situations where cleanup is a concern. However, they are not suitable for Class A (ordinary combustible) fires, as they do not provide the cooling effect necessary to extinguish those flames effectively. \nStainless steel fire extinguisher with instructions and K-Guard label.\n#### K-Class\nA K class extinguisher is specifically designed to combat fires involving cooking oils and fats, commonly found in commercial kitchens. These types of fires, classified as Class K fires, are particularly hazardous due to the high temperatures and the flammability of materials such as vegetable oils, animal fats, and other cooking media.\nThe chemicals inside a K class extinguisher typically include a potassium-based solution, which works by saponifying the burning oils. This process creates a thick, soap-like barrier that effectively cools the fire and prevents re-ignition. The formulation reduces the surface temperature of the burning oil, extinguishing the flames safely and efficiently.\n* * *\n### To learn more about all the different types of fire extinguishers, click HERE to be redirect to for our blog. \n\n## Subscribe to Our Newsletter\nSign up with your email address to receive news and updates.\nEmail Address\nSign Up\nThank you!\n­\n­\nRecaptcha requires verification. \n- \nprotected by **reCAPTCHA**\n-", "included_urls": ["https://www.bighorn-fire.com/", "https://www.bighorn-fire.com/#page", "https://www.bighorn-fire.com/backflows", "https://www.bighorn-fire.com/appointments", "https://www.bighorn-fire.com/firesprinkler", "https://www.bighorn-fire.com/fire-extinguisher-services"], "overflow": false, "length": {"chars": 18739, "approx_tokens": 4685}}

Book their services now to get a free quote!\n\n### Fire Protection Systems\nFire sprinklers and fire alarms are just some of the most well-known fire protection systems used in different establishments to safeguard the property against fire. As the name suggests, these systems give protection to a property by delivering numerous substances that will prevent a fire from spreading throughout the property and putting the lives of the people inside in danger.\n\n### Fire Sprinkler System Installation\nTo describe the whole installation process of fire sprinkler systems, it all starts with checking the water supply’s pressure. This is followed by installing pipings in the basement area because this is where the water supply will pass through when a fire occurs. Next, cages are put around the sprinkler heads to keep them protected, and the last step is making sure a leak test is performed.\n\n### Fire System Repair and Testing\nThere are two important methods that every fire sprinkler system should go through to ensure that they remain working fine and those are testing and repair. For testing, the fire systems will be operated and tested by professionals to make sure they function greatly and as for repair, professionals ensure that every damage due to numerous harmful elements and old age will be repaired the soonest.\n\n### Fire System Certification and Inspection\nInspections are normally done annually for the authorities to give residential and commercial property owners the assurance that their fire sprinkler systems can continue to provide the same intensity of protection regardless of how long they were already installed. Once these inspections were passed by property owners, they can not be worthy to receive a certification to prove that their fire sprinklers are safe to use.\n\n### Fire System Monitoring\nUnderstanding how fire monitoring work is important because it adds more knowledge to every individual as to how various components related to fire protection function. Fire monitoring is a process that helps reduce the extent of fire damage in a property by informing authorities the moment a fire occurs, which leads to a quicker response to the fire.\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n##### How does the fire suppression system work?\nTo extinguish, control, and prevent fires are the three major roles that fire suppression systems play in their respective lifetime. They identify early signs of smoke or fire and then send signals to alert those living inside the property and allowing them to find the exit and escape the fire before starting the process of emitting chemicals that will quickly cover the flames and extinguish them.\n##### What are the different types of fire suppression systems?\nEmergency fires can be the most destructive event that a property has to go through in its lifetime as it is detrimental to the property’s structure and the lives of the people. There are different types of fire suppression systems you can install to avoid this from happening on your property, and those are Pneumatic Heat Detection Tube, Foam Deluge Systems, Water-Based Fire Suppression Systems, Chemical Foam Suppression Systems, and Pressurized Gas System.\n##### How do you install a fire sprinkler system?\nWhen it comes to installing fire sprinkler systems at home, there are specific steps that need to be followed properly, not only for the sake of installing the system accurately but also for the safety of the people inside the building. The 1st step is checking water pressure, the 2nd step is installing piping in the basement. For the 3rd step, the sprinkler heads should be installed with cages, and lastly, the installer should perform a thorough leak testing.\n##### What is the most common fire suppression system?\nA fire suppression system that uses water to extinguish a fire is the most common type in the market for a very long time now. A water-based fire suppression system is preferred by many residential and commercial property owners not just for the affordability and safety it offers to the occupants all year round but also due to its quicker and more efficient installation process.\n##### What is fire suppression policy?\nYes, you can install clean agent fire suppression systems where people are present or living because these are all safe for the health of every individual as these systems’ toxicity level has been tested, and it is proven that they will not release any chemical that may pose any risk to any individual living or working inside that property. So if you’re planning to install this type of system on your property, know that there’s nothing for you to worry about.\n## Benefits of Fire Sprinkler System\n\n### Relatively Inexpensive\nThe affordability of fire sprinkler systems is because of their quick installation process and their actual price in the market. The relatively low cost of having a fire sprinkler system at home is one of the many benefits that make it even more worth the money and risk to invest in this home improvement to foster extreme fire protection at home.\n\n### Safety – Every Year, Sprinklers Save Lives\nFire deaths and injuries are inevitable whenever there is a fire incident on a property, and homeowners should find a solution to help in lowering the number of fire deaths. Fire sprinklers hold the most capacity to prioritize saving lives by sending signals to all the occupants inside a home or an establishment that will help them escape the fire.\n\n### Very Little Maintenance\nWith fire sprinkler systems, homeowners get one less thing to worry about and spend money on because these systems don’t need a lot of maintenance to work properly throughout the year. They also don’t get easily damaged due to the protective cages around the sprinkler heads to keep them safe from getting hit or bumped; saving you repair costs.\n\n### Reduce Insurance Premiums\nInsurance premiums may not be reduced whenever there’s a fire inside a property because fire sprinkler systems provide the utmost solution and extinguish a fire most swiftly. Since there will be reduced damage and even lower fire deaths, residential and commercial property owners are guaranteed that they will only have to pay more affordable insurance premiums.\n\n### Reduce the Risk and Extent of Damage\nFire sprinkler systems are not only responsible for reducing the extent of damage from fire incidents but also for making sure that the property will not be put at risk as much as possible. These systems will bring the most effective substances that will hinder any type of fire from growing and causing much damage to a property and the lives of the occupants.\n## Get A Free Quote\nFull Name\nEmail Address\nPhone Number\nJob Description/Details\nSubmit\n#### Call Or Text For a Free Quote\n#### (562) 609-4274\n#### Our Service Area\n### — Covina, CA\n### — Inglewood, CA\n### — Pomona, CA\nAll Service Areas\n\n### [PAGE] https://firesprinklersystemslongbeach.com/fire-protection-systems\n* Home\n * Services\n * All Services\n * Fire Protection Systems\n * Fire Sprinkler System Installation\n * Fire System Repair and Testing\n * Fire System Certification and Inspection\n * Fire System Monitoring\n * Service Area\n * Contact Us\n\n * Home\n * Services\n * All Services\n * Fire Protection Systems\n * Fire Sprinkler System Installation\n * Fire System Repair and Testing\n * Fire System Certification and Inspection\n * Fire System Monitoring\n * Service Area\n * Contact Us\n\n# Atlas Fire Sprinkler Systems Long Beach\n## Fire Protection Systems\n#### Call Us\n\n## Fire Suppression System \nLong Beach, CA\n(562) 609-4274\n### Get a Free Quote\nFull Name\nEmail Address\nPhone Number\nJob Description/Details\nSubmit\n\n### Fire Protection Systems\nFire sprinkler systems and fire alarms serve as critical components in fortifying establishments against the destructive impact of fires.

That’s why they’re commonly used in places like server rooms, museums, and medical facilities—anywhere you need fire protection without the mess or damage of water.\n##### What are the different types of fire suppression systems?\nFire suppression systems come in several types, each designed for different environments. Water-based systems are the most common, but there are also foam suppression systems for flammable liquids, dry chemical systems for industrial spaces, and clean agent gas systems for areas with sensitive electronics. Each system has a unique way of putting out fires while protecting specific property types.\n##### What is the most common fire suppression system?\nThe most commonly used fire suppression system is the traditional water sprinkler system. It’s found in homes, offices, and commercial buildings worldwide because of its effectiveness. When a fire is detected, heat activates the sprinkler heads, releasing water directly onto the flames to put them out. It’s a tried-and-true method for minimizing fire damage.\n##### How do you install a fire sprinkler system?\nInstalling a fire sprinkler system requires careful planning and professional expertise. First, experts design a system based on the building’s layout. Then, pipes are installed along ceilings and walls, connected to a reliable water source. Finally, sprinkler heads are placed in key areas to maximize coverage. Once installed, the system is tested to ensure it activates properly in an emergency.\n##### How does the fire suppression system work?\nA fire suppression system works by detecting fire through heat, smoke, or flame sensors. Once triggered, the system releases a suppression agent—water, gas, foam, or dry chemicals—to extinguish the fire before it spreads. These systems act fast, minimizing damage and allowing people to evacuate safely. Some systems also sound alarms to alert occupants of the emergency.\n## Benefits\n### Reduce Insurance Premiums\nInstalling a fire protection system could lower your insurance rates. Since fire suppression systems reduce the risk of severe fire damage, insurance companies often provide discounts to property owners who install them. Over time, these savings can add up, making it a practical way to reduce your overall costs while keeping your property secure.\n\n### Reduce the Risk and Extent of Damage\nFire can destroy everything in its path within minutes, but a reliable fire protection system can stop it in its tracks. Whether it’s a sprinkler system dousing flames with water or a clean agent system preventing fire from spreading, these systems limit destruction. Less fire damage means fewer repairs, less downtime for businesses, and, most importantly, saved lives.\n### Very Little Maintenance\nUnlike other home or business safety equipment that requires frequent servicing, fire protection systems are low maintenance. A professional inspection once or twice a year and occasional testing are usually all it takes to keep the system working properly. There’s no daily upkeep required, making it a stress-free way to ensure fire safety.\n\n### Relatively Inexpensive\nFire protection systems are a smart investment that saves you money in the long run. While there’s an upfront cost, it’s nothing compared to the financial loss a fire can cause. Think about it—repairing fire damage or replacing lost belongings can cost thousands. With an affordable fire safety system in place, you’re preventing major expenses before they happen.\n### Very Little Maintenance\nUnlike other home or business safety equipment that requires frequent servicing, fire protection systems are low maintenance. A professional inspection once or twice a year and occasional testing are usually all it takes to keep the system working properly. There’s no daily upkeep required, making it a stress-free way to ensure fire safety.\n\n## Areas We Serve\nAlhambra, CA\nArtesia, CA\nAvocado Heights, CA\nBell, CA\nBell Gardens, CA\nBurbank, CA\nCerritos, CA\nCommerce, CA\nCudahy, CA\nDiamond Bar, CA\nDowney, CA\nEast Los Angeles, CA\nEl Monte, CA\nFlorence-Graham, CA\nGlendale, CA\nHacienda Heights, CA\nHawaiian Gardens, CA\nHuntington Park, CA\nLa Mirada, CA\nLa Puente, CA\nMalibu, CA\nMaywood, CA\nMontebello, CA\nMonterey Park, CA\nNorwalk, CA\nParamount, CA\nPasadena, CA\nPico Rivera, CA\nRosemead, CA\nSan Gabriel, CA\nSan Marino, CA\nSanta Fe Springs, CA\nSierra Madre, CA\nSignal Hill, CA\nSouth San Gabriel, CA\nSouth Whittier, CA\nTemple City, CA\nWest Covina, CA\nWest Whittier, CA\nWhittier, CA\n### Get a Free Quote\nFull Name\nPhone Number\nEmail Address\nLocation - City, State\nJob Description/Details\nSubmit\n\n## Rightaway Fire Protection – Whittier CA\n(562) 451-4941\n\n#### Our Location\n7012 Vicki Dr, Whittier, CA 90606\n\n### [PAGE] https://fireprotectionwhittier.com/fire-protection-systems-in-artesia-get-a-free-quote-today\n* Home\n * Service Area\n * Contact Us\n\n * Home\n * Service Area\n * Contact Us\n\n# Established Residential Fire Protection Installaler Near Artesia, CA\nWhen you need help with fire protection in Artesia, we’re a call away—fast, fair, and reliable.\n### Get a Quote\nFull Name\nEmail Address\nPhone Number\nLocation - City, State\nJob Description/Details\nSubmit\n#### About Us\n## Residential Fire Protection Installaler in Artesia, CA\nEvery second counts in a fire.

Testing identifies where flow is restricted. Repairs include flushing, cleaning, or replacing sections.\n\n### Fire System Certification and Inspection\nRe-inspection is often required after spray foam repairs. Any patch or re-application must meet the same fire standards. Certified repair products must be used.\n\n### Commercial Fire Sprinkler Systems\nBusiness continuity depends on fast fire response. Sprinkler systems help minimize downtime and recovery costs. For many companies, this protection is essential.\n\n### Fire System Backflow Testing\nFire suppression systems with foam or chemicals pose high contamination risks. Backflow testing ensures these agents stay out of potable water. It’s essential in industrial and commercial settings.\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n##### Are clean agent fire suppression systems safe for people?\nYes, clean agent systems are human-safe and designed for environments where people and valuable assets coexist. The agents used are carefully engineered to avoid harmful side effects. They’re odorless, colorless, and don’t interfere with oxygen levels. Used in data centers and museums, they strike the right balance between protection and occupant safety.\n##### How do you install a fire sprinkler system?\nTo install, begin with design and permits. Install horizontal piping above ceilings or in exposed areas, then mount sprinkler heads according to fire codes. The network connects to a pressurized water line. After setting up monitoring systems, perform full testing and get local fire department approval before system activation.\n##### What is the most common fire suppression system?\nWet pipe sprinkler systems are the go-to fire suppression method. Always pressurized with water, they spring into action the moment heat activates a head. With low upkeep and high reliability, they’ve become the default solution for a broad range of properties, from homes to hospitals.\n##### What are the different types of fire suppression systems?\nYou’ll encounter six fire suppression system types: wet pipe, dry pipe, pre-action, deluge, clean agent, and foam. Wet and dry systems use water; pre-action adds control; deluge systems respond to large fires. Clean agents suppress fires with gas, ideal for electronics. Foam systems are best for liquid and fuel fires.\n##### How does the fire suppression system work?\nThese systems are designed to react quickly when fire is detected. Using heat sensors or smoke detectors, the system activates and releases a suppression agent. This might be a spray of water, a cloud of gas, or a foam layer—each chosen based on the fire risk in the area.\nRequest a Quote\n## Upgrade Your Artesia Property with a Fire Protection System\n### Get a Quote\nFull Name\nEmail Address\nPhone Number\nLocation - City, State\nJob Description/Details\nSubmit\n\n**Rightaway Fire Protection** is your dependable local specialist in residential and commercial fire safety.

It’s widely used in commercial, residential, and industrial buildings.\n##### What are the different types of fire suppression systems?\nThere are several types of fire suppression systems: wet pipe, dry pipe, pre-action, deluge, clean agent (like FM-200), and foam. Wet systems are common in homes; clean agents are best for sensitive equipment. Foam suits flammable liquids. Each system targets specific fire risks to ensure optimal protection.\n##### How does the fire suppression system work?\nFire suppression systems work by automatically detecting fire conditions such as heat or smoke. Once triggered, the system activates and discharges a fire-suppressing agent—either water, chemical foam, or gas—through nozzles or sprinkler heads. This stops the fire, often before it spreads, protecting both life and property.\nRequest a Quote\n## Upgrade Your Avocado Heights Property with a Fire Protection System\n### Get a Quote\nFull Name\nEmail Address\nPhone Number\nLocation - City, State\nJob Description/Details\nSubmit\n\n**Rightaway Fire Protection** is your dependable local specialist in residential and commercial fire safety.
