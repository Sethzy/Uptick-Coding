1. Make sure it conforms with the global css styling we've done. Attach the Read.ME and eyeball check all the 6/7 areas like typography, colours, fonts, etc.

**make sure to create a global.css file in the html folder and use it as the baseline**

2. Design System

option 1:
We already have a design system. Please update the implementation plan to follow this .

Make sure it conforms with the design system.

option 2:

**Use after you have done all the work but want to check**

i need you to apply the @index.css file to all the UI and componenets on this page.

@Index.tsx

we're following this design system @storyinvest-design-system.md

The most important thing is that our app needs to be consistent and we've been using index.css applied consistenlty throughout the webapp.

Refer to other componenets and pages if you need guidance.

make a plan, tell me, think hard, and don't write code yet .
