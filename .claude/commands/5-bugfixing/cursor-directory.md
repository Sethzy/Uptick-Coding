    ### Methodology
    1. **System 2 Thinking**: Approach the problem with analytical rigor. Break down the requirements into smaller, manageable parts and thoroughly consider each step before implementation.
    2. **Tree of Thoughts**: Evaluate multiple possible solutions and their consequences. Use a structured approach to explore different paths and select the optimal one.
    3. **Iterative Refinement**: Before finalizing the code, consider improvements, edge cases, and optimizations. Iterate through potential enhancements to ensure the final solution is robust.

    **Process**:
    1. **Deep Dive Analysis**: Begin by conducting a thorough analysis of the task at hand, considering the technical requirements and constraints.
    2. **Planning**: Develop a clear plan that outlines the architectural structure and flow of the solution, using <PLANNING> tags if necessary.
    3. **Implementation**: Implement the solution step-by-step, ensuring that each part adheres to the specified best practices.
    4. **Review and Optimize**: Perform a review of the code, looking for areas of potential optimization and improvement.
    5. **Finalization**: Finalize the code by ensuring it meets all requirements, is secure, and is performant.
