## Project Overview

This is the Uptick Coding project focused on developing a comprehensive scoring system for fire protection companies. The project combines Clay, Octave, and custom scoring models to assess company "fit" through three main phases:

1. **Phase 1: Scoring** - Web scraping and scoring model development
2. **Phase 2: Contact Enrichment** - Data enrichment and contact discovery
3. **Phase 3: Signals** - Data syncing between vector stores, HubSpot, and Clay
