Tom Anderson launched the company with a $2,500 loan and an ’82 Ford van, securing a partnership with Amerex to deliver essential services. By 1993, FPS hired its first employee and expanded its fleet, marking the start of a growing team.\n\nIn 1994, FPS added hood cleaning services and established its first shop in Barre Mills, WI, alongside a Fire Suppression Systems Division. Continued growth led to the launch of a Fire Alarm Division in 2000 and a move to a larger 10,000-square-foot facility in Bangor, WI, in 2004. FPS expanded further in 2018 with a second location in Eau Claire, WI, and in 2024, acquired a neighboring building in Bangor to create a dedicated space for its Hood Cleaning Division and a state-of-the-art conference room, transforming the site into a complete operational hub.\n\nOur skilled team of certified technicians and experienced project managers is committed to delivering tailored fire protection solutions with excellence and customer satisfaction.\n\n## Our Services\n\nFire Extinguishers\nWe offer reliable fire extinguisher services, including sales, installation, inspections, recharging, and maintenance, to ensure your safety and compliance.\nLearn More\n\nFire Alarms\nWe provide comprehensive fire alarm services, including installation, inspection, maintenance, and monitoring, to keep your property safe and code-compliant.\nLearn More\n\nCellular Monitoring\nUpgrade to reliable cellular monitoring for your fire alarm system, ensuring seamless communication and enhanced safety without the need for traditional phone lines.\nLearn More\n\nFire Suppression\nWe specialize in industrial and kitchen fire suppression systems, providing expert installation, inspection, maintenance, and repairs to safeguard your business and ensure compliance.\nLearn More\n\nHood Cleaning\nWe provide professional hood cleaning services for commercial kitchens, ensuring your exhaust systems are clean, safe, and compliant with fire codes.\nLearn More\n\nFire Sprinklers\nWe offer expert sprinkler system services, including installation, inspection, maintenance, and repairs, to protect your property and ensure fire code compliance.\nLearn More\n\nComprehensive Design\nFrom concept to completion, our comprehensive fire protection design services ensure tailored solutions that meet your specific safety needs and regulatory standards.\nLearn More\n\nHands-On Extinguisher Training\nWe offer hands-on fire extinguisher training, giving participants real-world experience in safely and effectively using extinguishers during a live fire scenario.\nLearn More\n\nEmergency / Exit Lights\nEnsure safety and compliance with our professional emergency exit light inspection, maintenance, and repair services.\nLearn More\n\nCompliance Tracking\nEnsure peace of mind with our comprehensive compliance tracking services, keeping your fire protection systems up to date and meeting all regulatory requirements.\nLearn More\n\"Everyone at Fire Protection Specialists are very professional and friendly.

It uses sensors, detectors, and a control panel to trigger audible and visual alarms, providing critical time to evacuate and respond to emergencies.\n### Do I need a fire alarm system in my home or business?\nYes. Fire alarms are essential for safety and are often required by local fire codes for both residential and commercial properties. They provide early warnings, which can save lives and prevent significant property damage.\n  * Conventional Systems: Ideal for smaller buildings, dividing the property into zones to locate potential fires.\n  * Addressable Systems: Perfect for larger properties, offering precise identification of fire locations.\n  * Combination Systems: Combine fire detection with smoke and carbon monoxide alarms for comprehensive safety.\n\n\nFire alarms should be tested monthly for basic functionality. Annual inspections by certified technicians ensure all components are working properly and meet fire safety standards.\n\n\n### How do I know if my fire alarm system needs an upgrade?\nYour system might need upgrading if it’s over 10–15 years old, frequently malfunctions, or doesn’t meet updated fire codes. A modern system ensures optimal performance and compliance.\n\n\nBasic smoke detectors can be DIY-installed, but comprehensive fire alarm systems require professional installation to ensure proper setup and compliance with safety codes.\n\n\nCentral monitoring connects your fire alarm system to a 24/7 monitoring center. If an alarm is triggered, the system automatically alerts the monitoring center, which can contact emergency services for a faster response.\nNo. Modern systems can use cellular or internet-based connections, providing reliable communication without requiring a landline.\n  * Monitored Systems: Automatically alert emergency services through a monitoring center.\n  * Non-Monitored Systems: Trigger only audible alarms, requiring someone on-site to take action.\n\n\n### Can I upgrade my existing fire alarm system to include central monitoring?\nYes. Many modern fire alarm systems are compatible with central monitoring. We can assess your current system and recommend upgrades to integrate monitoring seamlessly.\nYes, we provide professional installation to ensure your property is protected and compliant with local fire codes.\n### How long does it take to install a fire alarm system?\nInstallation time depends on the size and complexity of your property.

A fire extinguisher is a portable device used to control or extinguish small fires in emergency situations. It works by releasing a substance—such as water, foam, dry powder, or carbon dioxide—that interrupts the fire's chemical reaction, removing heat, oxygen, or fuel.\nHow many fire extinguishers do I need for my home or business? For homes, it’s recommended to have at least one fire extinguisher per floor, especially near the kitchen, garage, and any high-risk areas. Businesses should follow local fire codes, which often require fire extinguishers within 75 feet of travel distance in most environments.\nWhat are the different types of fire extinguishers, and what are they used for?\n  * Class A: For ordinary combustibles like wood, paper, and cloth.\n  * Class B: For flammable liquids like oil, grease, and gasoline.\n  * Class K: For kitchen fires involving cooking oils and fats.\n\n\nHow do I know which fire extinguisher is right for me?\nThe type of extinguisher you need depends on the potential fire hazards in your space. For example, kitchens require a Class K extinguisher, while businesses with electrical equipment may need a Class C. We can help you choose the best option.\nWhere should I place fire extinguishers in my home or business? Place fire extinguishers in visible and easily accessible locations near high-risk areas, such as the kitchen, garage, or exit points.

If the extinguisher is partially discharged, it may need to be recharged.

A visual inspection involves checking the pressure gauge, seals, and overall condition. Professional servicing includes testing, refilling, and verifying the extinguisher’s performance.\nHow do I know if my fire extinguisher needs recharging? Look at the pressure gauge. If the needle is in the “red” zone, it needs recharging. Also, extinguishers that have been partially discharged must be refilled immediately.\nNo, disposable fire extinguishers cannot be recharged. They must be replaced after use or if they are expired.\nHow can I tell if my fire extinguisher has expired? Check the manufacturer’s date stamped on the label or cylinder. Most fire extinguishers have a lifespan of 5–15 years. If it’s older than this or shows signs of damage, replace it.\nFire extinguishers typically last 5–15 years, depending on the type and maintenance. Regular inspections can help extend their life.\nRequirements vary by location and industry, but generally, businesses must:\n\n\nAre there laws about having fire extinguishers in vehicles or machinery?

Yes, commercial kitchens require Class K fire extinguishers to combat fires caused by cooking oils and fats.\nWhile training isn’t legally required for homeowners, it’s highly recommended to know how to use one safely. For businesses, training is often required by OSHA and other local regulations.\nCan I use a fire extinguisher on any type of fire? No, using the wrong extinguisher can make a fire worse. For example, using water on an electrical or grease fire can spread flames. Always ensure you have the right extinguisher for the type of fire.\n  * If you’re not sure which type of extinguisher to use.\n\n\nWhat should I do if a fire extinguisher doesn’t work during an emergency? Immediately evacuate the area and call 911. Never attempt to fight a fire with a faulty extinguisher.\nHow do I dispose of an old or empty fire extinguisher? Contact your local waste disposal service or bring it to us.
