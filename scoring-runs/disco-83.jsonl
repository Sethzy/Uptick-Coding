Contact our sales team for more information.\n#### Inspections\nWe offer yearly fire extinguisher inspections based on NFPA 10 at a competitive price. We look for any needed services and ensure the extinguisher has the right labels, pressure, and is properly mounted according to NFPA 10 rules.\n#### Hydrostatic Tests & 6YR Maintenance\nWe offer 12-year hydrostatic testing for ABC extinguishers as well as 5-year hydrostatic testing for CO2 and water-based extinguishers. We also offer 6-year maintenance and recharges for extinguisher types that require maintenance.\n#### New Extinguishers\nBFP can provide new extinguishers and installation of them as well. We follow NFPA 10 guidelines to meet compliance regulations.\n\n## What is involved with an NFPA 10 fire extinguisher inspection?\nAn NFPA 10 annual fire extinguisher inspection is crucial for ensuring fire safety in any facility. This comprehensive evaluation guarantees that your fire extinguishers are functional, compliant, and ready to operate in case of an emergency. Here\u2019s what customers can expect during the inspection process.\n#### Inspection Process Overview\nVisual Inspection\n: Inspectors will assess the overall condition of each fire extinguisher, looking for signs of damage, corrosion, or tampering. They will check that the extinguisher is mounted securely and accessible in case of an emergency.\nPressure Check\n: The pressure gauge will be inspected to ensure it falls within the acceptable range. Extinguishers with low pressure may not function effectively when needed.\nPhysical Condition\n: Technicians will examine the nozzle, hose, and other mechanical components for obstructions or deterioration. An unobstructed nozzle is vital for effective fire suppression.\nLabeling and Instruction Check\n: Inspectors will verify that each extinguisher has clear, readable labels and instructions. These should be easily visible to anyone who may need to use the extinguisher.\nMaintenance Tag Review\n: The inspector will check the maintenance tags on each extinguisher to ensure they are up to date with inspections.\nAnnual Documentation\n: After the inspection, customers will receive a detailed report that outlines the condition of each extinguisher, any issues found, and recommendations for corrective actions. This documentation is essential for compliance and record-keeping. The extinguisher will receive a current tag with the type of extinguisher, the year (hole-punched), etc. BFP does not tag fire extinguishers that have found deficiencies.\n#### Why Choose Us for Your Inspection\nAt Bighorn Fire Protection, we pride ourselves on our commitment to safety and professionalism. Our trained technicians follow NFPA standards meticulously, providing you with the peace of mind that your fire extinguishers are in top condition. Conducting regular inspections not only ensures compliance with local fire codes but also enhances the safety of your facility\u2019s occupants. Choose Bighorn Fire Protection for an expert inspection and experience the assurance that comes from knowing your fire safety equipment is reliable when it matters most.\n## The Different Types of Extinguishers\n\n#### ABC\nABC extinguishers are designed to effectively combat a variety of fire hazards, specifically targeting Type A hazards, Type B hazards, and Type C hazards.\nThis versatility is precisely why they are commonly referred to as \"ABC Extinguishers.\" These extinguishers provide a comprehensive solution for fire emergencies, ensuring that both solid, liquid, and gas-based fires can be safely addressed.\nABC extinguishers contain a dry chemical agent, typically composed of monoammonium phosphate, which is effective for extinguishing fires classified as A (ordinary combustibles), B (flammable liquids), and C (electrical fires).\nThis multipurpose agent works by interrupting the chemical reaction of the fire triangle and effectively suppresses flames across various fire types.\n\n#### CO2\nCO2 extinguishers, or carbon dioxide extinguishers, are utilized primarily for fighting Class B (liquid) and Class C (electrical) fires. Their effectiveness lies in their ability to displace oxygen in the area of the fire, thereby suffocating the flames.\nThe contents of a CO2 extinguisher comprise carbon dioxide gas, which is stored under pressure in a cylinder. When activated, a nozzle directs the gas toward the fire. CO2 is non-conductive, making it suitable for use in environments where electrical equipment is present, such as server rooms and electrical panels.\nOne significant advantage of CO2 extinguishers is that they leave no residue after use, making them ideal for situations where cleanup is a concern. However, they are not suitable for Class A (ordinary combustible) fires, as they do not provide the cooling effect necessary to extinguish those flames effectively.\n\n#### K-Class\nA K class extinguisher is specifically designed to combat fires involving cooking oils and fats, commonly found in commercial kitchens. These types of fires, classified as Class K fires, are particularly hazardous due to the high temperatures and the flammability of materials such as vegetable oils, animal fats, and other cooking media.\nThe chemicals inside a K class extinguisher typically include a potassium-based solution, which works by saponifying the burning oils. This process creates a thick, soap-like barrier that effectively cools the fire and prevents re-ignition. The formulation reduces the surface temperature of the burning oil, extinguishing the flames safely and efficiently.\n### To learn more about all the different types of fire extinguishers, click HERE to be redirect to for our blog.\n\n## Subscribe to Our Newsletter\nSign up with your email address to receive news and updates.\nEmail Address\nSign Up\nThank you!", "included_urls": ["https://www.bighorn-fire.com/", "https://www.bighorn-fire.com/#page", "https://www.bighorn-fire.com/backflows", "https://www.bighorn-fire.com/appointments", "https://www.bighorn-fire.com/firesprinkler", "https://www.bighorn-fire.com/fire-extinguisher-services"], "overflow": false, "length": {"chars": 15583, "approx_tokens": 3896}, "record_id": "31779707260"}

Book their services now to get a free quote!\n\n### Fire Protection Systems\nFire sprinklers and fire alarms are just some of the most well-known fire protection systems used in different establishments to safeguard the property against fire. As the name suggests, these systems give protection to a property by delivering numerous substances that will prevent a fire from spreading throughout the property and putting the lives of the people inside in danger.\n\n### Fire Sprinkler System Installation\nTo describe the whole installation process of fire sprinkler systems, it all starts with checking the water supply\u2019s pressure. This is followed by installing pipings in the basement area because this is where the water supply will pass through when a fire occurs. Next, cages are put around the sprinkler heads to keep them protected, and the last step is making sure a leak test is performed.\n\n### Fire System Repair and Testing\nThere are two important methods that every fire sprinkler system should go through to ensure that they remain working fine and those are testing and repair. For testing, the fire systems will be operated and tested by professionals to make sure they function greatly and as for repair, professionals ensure that every damage due to numerous harmful elements and old age will be repaired the soonest.\n\n### Fire System Certification and Inspection\nInspections are normally done annually for the authorities to give residential and commercial property owners the assurance that their fire sprinkler systems can continue to provide the same intensity of protection regardless of how long they were already installed.

Clean agent fire suppression systems are designed to be safe for people while effectively stopping fires. These systems use gases that quickly suppress flames without leaving any residue or harming breathing air. That\u2019s why they\u2019re commonly used in places like server rooms, museums, and medical facilities\u2014anywhere you need fire protection without the mess or damage of water.\n##### What are the different types of fire suppression systems?\nFire suppression systems come in several types, each designed for different environments. Water-based systems are the most common, but there are also foam suppression systems for flammable liquids, dry chemical systems for industrial spaces, and clean agent gas systems for areas with sensitive electronics. Each system has a unique way of putting out fires while protecting specific property types.\n##### What is the most common fire suppression system?\nThe most commonly used fire suppression system is the traditional water sprinkler system. It\u2019s found in homes, offices, and commercial buildings worldwide because of its effectiveness. When a fire is detected, heat activates the sprinkler heads, releasing water directly onto the flames to put them out. It\u2019s a tried-and-true method for minimizing fire damage.\n##### How do you install a fire sprinkler system?\nInstalling a fire sprinkler system requires careful planning and professional expertise. First, experts design a system based on the building\u2019s layout. Then, pipes are installed along ceilings and walls, connected to a reliable water source. Finally, sprinkler heads are placed in key areas to maximize coverage. Once installed, the system is tested to ensure it activates properly in an emergency.\n##### How does the fire suppression system work?\nA fire suppression system works by detecting fire through heat, smoke, or flame sensors. Once triggered, the system releases a suppression agent\u2014water, gas, foam, or dry chemicals\u2014to extinguish the fire before it spreads. These systems act fast, minimizing damage and allowing people to evacuate safely. Some systems also sound alarms to alert occupants of the emergency.\n## Benefits\n### Reduce Insurance Premiums\nInstalling a fire protection system could lower your insurance rates. Since fire suppression systems reduce the risk of severe fire damage, insurance companies often provide discounts to property owners who install them. Over time, these savings can add up, making it a practical way to reduce your overall costs while keeping your property secure.\n\n### Reduce the Risk and Extent of Damage\nFire can destroy everything in its path within minutes, but a reliable fire protection system can stop it in its tracks. Whether it\u2019s a sprinkler system dousing flames with water or a clean agent system preventing fire from spreading, these systems limit destruction. Less fire damage means fewer repairs, less downtime for businesses, and, most importantly, saved lives.\n### Very Little Maintenance \nUnlike other home or business safety equipment that requires frequent servicing, fire protection systems are low maintenance. A professional inspection once or twice a year and occasional testing are usually all it takes to keep the system working properly. There\u2019s no daily upkeep required, making it a stress-free way to ensure fire safety.\n\n### Relatively Inexpensive\nFire protection systems are a smart investment that saves you money in the long run. While there\u2019s an upfront cost, it\u2019s nothing compared to the financial loss a fire can cause. Think about it\u2014repairing fire damage or replacing lost belongings can cost thousands. With an affordable fire safety system in place, you\u2019re preventing major expenses before they happen.\n### Very Little Maintenance\nUnlike other home or business safety equipment that requires frequent servicing, fire protection systems are low maintenance. A professional inspection once or twice a year and occasional testing are usually all it takes to keep the system working properly.

These systems use non-toxic, electrically non-conductive gases that leave no residue behind. They suppress fires without harming occupants or damaging equipment. Because they quickly displace heat and interrupt combustion without reducing oxygen levels significantly, they\u2019re ideal for occupied spaces like server rooms, offices, and control centers.\n##### How do you install a fire sprinkler system?\nInstalling a fire sprinkler system starts with a site assessment and code compliance review. Professionals design a layout based on the building\u2019s structure and occupancy. After water supply calculations, pipes and sprinkler heads are installed, followed by pressure testing and inspection. Once certified, the system is activated and maintained annually.\n##### What is the most common fire suppression system?\nThe most common fire suppression system is the automatic fire sprinkler system. It\u2019s widely used in commercial, industrial, and residential buildings because it\u2019s reliable, cost-effective, and responds quickly to heat. Sprinklers activate individually, releasing water only where fire is present, minimizing damage while containing flames. It\u2019s the industry standard for everyday fire protection.\n##### What are the different types of fire suppression systems?\nFire suppression systems come in various types: wet pipe, dry pipe, pre-action, and deluge systems. Beyond water-based systems, there are also chemical, foam, and clean agent systems for sensitive areas. Each type is designed to suppress fires in specific environments quickly and effectively.\n##### How does the fire suppression system work?\nA fire suppression system works by detecting heat, smoke, or flames and automatically releasing a suppression agent. Depending on the system, this may be water, gas, foam, or chemicals. The agent interrupts the fire\u2019s combustion process, cools the area, or removes oxygen. These systems operate quickly to control or extinguish fires, protecting people and property.\nGet a Quote\n## Upgrade Your Property Anywhere in Alhambra\n### Get a Quote\nFull Name\nEmail Address\nPhone Number\nLocation - City, State\nJob Description/Details\nSubmit\n\nRivers Fire Protection\nis your reliable local specialist in residential and commercial fire safety.

Additionally, this process ensures that non-potable water doesn\u2019t flow backward, potentially compromising the system\u2019s effectiveness. Our certified technicians offer thorough testing services, safeguarding your system\u2019s reliability and compliance.\n## F.A.Q.\nFor your convenience, we have gathered some commonly asked questions from our customers.\n##### Are clean agent fire suppression systems safe for people?\nYes! Clean agent fire suppression systems are designed to fight fires without harming people. Instead of water, they use gases that remove heat or block the fire\u2019s chemical reaction. These gases don\u2019t reduce oxygen levels, so they\u2019re safe to use in occupied spaces like offices, hospitals, and server rooms. Plus, they leave no residue, meaning no cleanup or equipment damage.\n##### How do you install a fire sprinkler system?\nInstalling a fire sprinkler system involves careful planning and professional installation. First, experts design the system based on your building\u2019s layout. Then, they install pipes and sprinkler heads in key areas. The system is connected to a water source and tested to ensure it activates properly in case of a fire. Hiring professionals ensures everything is up to safety standards.\n##### What is the most common fire suppression system?\nThe most widely used fire suppression system is the automatic fire sprinkler system. It\u2019s the go-to choice for homes, businesses, and industrial buildings because it\u2019s highly effective. When heat from a fire reaches a certain level, the sprinkler heads activate, releasing water to put out the flames before they spread. It\u2019s a proven method for reducing fire damage.\n##### What are the different types of fire suppression systems?\nFire suppression systems come in several types, each designed for different situations. Water-based sprinklers are the most common, but there are also clean agent gas systems for places with electronics, foam-based systems for fuel fires, and dry chemical systems for industrial use. The right system depends on the environment and the kind of fire risks involved.\n##### How does the fire suppression system work?\nA fire suppression system works by detecting fire through heat, smoke, or flame sensors. Once triggered, it activates and releases its suppression agent\u2014water, gas, foam, or chemicals\u2014to put out the fire. Some systems also trigger alarms to alert occupants, while others work silently in the background, stopping fires before they become disasters. This makes this an important investment to safeguard lives and properties.\n## The Benefits\n### Relatively Inexpensive\nFire protection systems are one of the most affordable safety measures you can install. The cost of installation is small compared to the financial burden of fire damage, repairs, and lost belongings. Think of it as an investment that pays for itself by preventing costly disasters before they happen. A little upfront spending can save you from massive losses later.\n\n### Increase The Value Of Your Property\nA building with a fire protection system instantly stands out to buyers and tenants. It shows that the property is up to code, well-maintained, and safer to live or work in. Whether you own a home, apartment complex, or business, having a reliable fire suppression system can make your property more desirable and increase its market value.\n\n### Very Little Maintenance \nFire protection systems are built to be reliable with minimal upkeep. Unlike other safety equipment that needs frequent checkups, fire sprinklers and suppression systems only require occasional inspections and testing. Once installed, they work automatically, meaning you don\u2019t have to constantly monitor them. Just schedule routine maintenance, and you\u2019re all set.\n\n### Reduce Insurance Premiums\nInsurance companies love fire protection systems because they lower the risk of property damage. When you install one, many insurers will offer you discounts on your premiums. These savings add up over time, making it a wise investment for your home and business. It\u2019s a win-win: you get better fire safety, and you pay less for insurance.\n\n### Reduce the Risk and Extent of Damage \nA fire can spread in seconds, turning small flames into a raging disaster. Fire protection systems act quickly, either putting out the fire completely or slowing it down until help arrives. This means less structural damage, fewer repairs, and, most importantly, a higher chance of keeping everyone inside safe.\n\n## Victory Fire Protection \n\u2013 Norco CA\n\ue081\n#### 4740 Roundup Rd, Norco, CA 92860\n##### Email Us\nGet a Free Quote\nFull Name\nEmail Address\nPhone Number\nLocation - City, State\nJob Description/Details\nSubmit", "included_urls": ["https://fireprotectionriversidecounty.com"], "overflow": false, "length": {"chars": 8214, "approx_tokens": 2054}, "record_id": "30797703095"}

It serves as a means of egress for a quick and safe exit, helping to avoid injuries amid the chaos.\n\nEnsuring compliance with NFPA 101 regulations is essential, and our monthly and annual inspections are here to assist you. By entrusting us with your inspections, you can focus on your business operations while we help you take care of this critical aspect of your safety program.\n### Emergency Exit Light Inspections\nWith extreme weather events, emergencies or other unforeseen circumstances, you are bound to experience a power outage sooner or later.\nWhen that happens, having fully functioning exit signs and emergency lights is critical to the safety of those in the building.\nThompson Safety is a leading service provider for the testing, maintenance, repair, and replacement of exit and emergency lights to ensure that you are up to code and are providing a safe environment for your building occupants.\nAn Annual Exit / Emergency Lighting Inspection is required per NFPA 101, NFPA 70 and OSHA 29CFR1910. The experts at Thompson have the knowledge and know-how to handle all your exit sign and emergency lighting needs.\n### How The Service Works\nFacility Walkthrough:\nonsite assessment to determine the number/type/location of exit lights based on the square footage, specific hazards, exits and path of egress\nInspections:\nbased on the facility walkthrough we determine the appropriate service/maintenance program to continue or bring your equipment up to code.\nService Interval:\nestablish the appropriate service frequency, which will depend on the specific equipment being maintained and local requirements.\nDocumentation:\nprovide thorough documentation of all services performed, notations and deficiencies, in written or digital formats.\nInvoicing:\nmultiple payment and billing options for your convenience.\nOngoing Support:\n24/7 customer service and account access\n### Annual VS Monthly Inspections\nIn most jurisdictions, two types of inspections are required for all exit and emergency lighting. The first type is a monthly visual/push test, which serves the purpose of confirming the operational status and direction of the lights. Additionally, it helps to validate that, at the time of inspection, the battery will activate when the light loses power.\nThe second type is an annual inspection, often known as a \"90-minute test\" or a \"load test\" in certain jurisdictions. The primary objective of this inspection is to assess whether the backup battery can maintain lighting for the necessary duration (typically 90 minutes) during a power outage or emergency situation. Both inspections are mandated by NFPA 101; however, we recommend always consulting your local Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ) to understand acceptable testing and inspection methods.\n### Exit & Emergency Light Testing, Inspections, and Maintenance\nTo keep you code-compliant and safe, we follow a strict process. Here is what you can expect from our expert team:\nIf applicable, each battery is tested with a load tester to simulate a 90-minute function test on the battery.\nE-light charging units will be tested to confirm that the batteries are not being over (posing a fire hazard) or under charged.\nAll emergency light beams will be adjusted for proper egress lighting.\nA check verifying that the proper amount of power is reaching the emergency/light exit will be performed.\nAll exit signs and emergency lights will have a service label affixed to them indicating the month, year, and type of service performed.\nA complete and detailed e-light report will be provided to the customer for submittal to the insurance company and/or fire department \u2013 meeting OHSA documentation requirements.\n### Repairs and Replacement\nIf you are experiencing problems, or if testing reveals that your emergency lighting units aren\u2019t functioning properly, we can help! Our experienced crew has the tools and equipment to make the necessary repairs so that everything is up and running in no time.\nNeed to replace or upgrade your unit? We can handle that with top-of-the-line replacement exit signs and emergency lighting.\nDISCLAIMER\n: The content provided on this website is intended solely for informational purposes.

Fire suppression systems, fire sprinklers, and smoke detectors are just some of these fire protection systems, and they could either passively or actively control fires of any type.\n\n## Fire Sprinkler System Installation\nA successful installation process of fire sprinkler systems involves the participation of professional installers who will be responsible for following every step needed to guarantee home and business owners a safe and quick installation process to lessen the disruption to the flow of their business. With a straight-to-the-point installation process, these systems won\u2019t need a huge amount of money and time.\n\n## Fire Systems Repair and Testing\nHaving fire sprinkler systems on your property makes a huge difference in case a fire breaks during your most vulnerable moments, as they\u2019ll be ready to spray water and eventually extinguish the fire. Every test made for your sprinkler systems yields a better performance from them, while repairs will make sure they remain ready for use and won\u2019t malfunction when utilized.\n\n## Fire System Certification \n## and Inspection\nFire systems inspections involve visiting homes and other sites where fire systems are installed to check and confirm that they remained properly installed and given sufficient maintenance by the owners. After performing a thorough and detailed inspection of these systems, owners will receive a fire system certification certifying that their systems are ready for use whenever a fire ensues\n\n## Fire System \n## Monitoring\nSo how does a fire system monitoring work? Without being so technical, these systems monitor homes to catch any possible signs that a fire is present inside the property. After its fire detection, it will then start rapid communication with the property\u2019s security provider\u2019s central monitor station to inform them regarding the smoke or fire and facilitate a quick fire response.\n\n## Fire Extinguisher \n## Certification\nFire extinguisher certification is a robust credential given to individuals that will show their expertise and knowledge in utilizing fire extinguishers after attending training and courses. Various courses are offered for individuals with an interest in learning how to handle and maintain fire extinguishers during fire incidents as well as knowing how to facilitate effective and safe evacuation procedures.\n\n# **Frequently Asked**\n# **Questions**\n#### How does the fire suppression system work?\nFire suppression systems recognize any sign that indicates the existence of fire inside a property and then suppress the fire using a specialized chemical the system possesses. When the system is activated due to the heat and fire it detected, it will immediately start controlling the fire to reduce the damage the building may suffer from. By eliminating heat and oxygen, fire suppression systems ensure that fires will be managed the soonest.\n#### How do you install a fire sprinkler system?\nThe process of fire sprinkler systems installation goes like this: First, your technician will create a custom-designed sprinkler system for each room after checking your water supply\u2019s pressure. The second step would be putting steel pipings on walls and floors to allow water to pass through, while the third step is installing protective cages for the sprinkler heads. The fourth or last step is a leak test performed by your pro-installer.\n#### Are clean agents fire suppression systems safe for people?\nWith the use of inert gas and non-toxic chemicals, clean agent fire suppression systems are safe for the health of people inside the building where the system is installed. The system also has a five-minute exposure limit, which means inhaling a few amounts of the chemicals won\u2019t do any harm to the body but before the systems fully activate, it\u2019s safer for people to already evacuate from the establishment\n#### What are the different types of fire suppression systems?\nHere is a list of the different types of fire suppression systems you may have already encountered in the market but have no idea what its called: Chemical Foam Suppression Systems, Foam Deluge Systems, Water-Based Fire Suppression Systems, Pneumatic Heat Detection Tubes, and Pressurized Gas System. The five types of fire suppression systems can effectively help prevent your photos, documents, and other valuables from being taken away by the fire.\n#### What is the most common fire suppression system?\nThe most common type of fire suppression system or method a large population prefers to use in extinguishing fires is the Water-Based fire suppression system. Part of the reason is that buildings usually have a water supply, so installing this type yields an easier installation process. Besides the mentioned reason, the affordability, and efficiency of Water-Based fire suppression systems also has a huge impact on why it\u2019s the most popular type.\n# **TESTIMONIALS**\n# **What Client Our Says About Us**\n**Our experience with Veteran Fire was excellent.**\n**They walked the facility, assessed the situation, and provided a detailed and competitive quote within a few days.

Every test made for your sprinkler systems yields a better performance from them, while repairs will make sure they remain ready for use and won\u2019t malfunction when utilized.\n\n## Fire System Certification\n## and Inspection\nFire systems inspections involve visiting homes and other sites where fire systems are installed to check and confirm that they remained properly installed and given sufficient maintenance by the owners. After performing a thorough and detailed inspection of these systems, owners will receive a fire system certification certifying that their systems are ready for use whenever a fire ensues\n\n## Fire System\n## Monitoring\nSo how does a fire system monitoring work? Without being so technical, these systems monitor homes to catch any possible signs that a fire is present inside the property. After its fire detection, it will then start rapid communication with the property\u2019s security provider\u2019s central monitor station to inform them regarding the smoke or fire and facilitate a quick fire response.\n\n## Fire Extinguisher\n## Certification\nFire extinguisher certification is a robust credential given to individuals that will show their expertise and knowledge in utilizing fire extinguishers after attending training and courses. Various courses are offered for individuals with an interest in learning how to handle and maintain fire extinguishers during fire incidents as well as knowing how to facilitate effective and safe evacuation procedures.\n\n# Frequently Asked\n# Questions\n#### How does the fire suppression system work?\nFire suppression systems recognize any sign that indicates the existence of fire inside a property and then suppress the fire using a specialized chemical the system possesses. When the system is activated due to the heat and fire it detected, it will immediately start controlling the fire to reduce the damage the building may suffer from. By eliminating heat and oxygen, fire suppression systems ensure that fires will be managed the soonest.\n#### How do you install a fire sprinkler system?\nThe process of fire sprinkler systems installation goes like this: First, your technician will create a custom-designed sprinkler system for each room after checking your water supply\u2019s pressure. The second step would be putting steel pipings on walls and floors to allow water to pass through, while the third step is installing protective cages for the sprinkler heads. The fourth or last step is a leak test performed by your pro-installer.\n#### Are clean agents fire suppression systems safe for people?\nWith the use of inert gas and non-toxic chemicals, clean agent fire suppression systems are safe for the health of people inside the building where the system is installed. The system also has a five-minute exposure limit, which means inhaling a few amounts of the chemicals won\u2019t do any harm to the body but before the systems fully activate, it\u2019s safer for people to already evacuate from the establishment\n#### What are the different types of fire suppression systems?\nHere is a list of the different types of fire suppression systems you may have already encountered in the market but have no idea what its called: Chemical Foam Suppression Systems, Foam Deluge Systems, Water-Based Fire Suppression Systems, Pneumatic Heat Detection Tubes, and Pressurized Gas System. The five types of fire suppression systems can effectively help prevent your photos, documents, and other valuables from being taken away by the fire.\n#### What is the most common fire suppression system?\nThe most common type of fire suppression system or method a large population prefers to use in extinguishing fires is the Water-Based fire suppression system. Part of the reason is that buildings usually have a water supply, so installing this type yields an easier installation process. Besides the mentioned reason, the affordability, and efficiency of Water-Based fire suppression systems also has a huge impact on why it\u2019s the most popular type.\n# TESTIMONIALS\n# What Client Our Says About Us\nOur experience with Veteran Fire was excellent.\nThey walked the facility, assessed the situation, and provided a detailed and competitive quote within a few days.

We have over 50 years of combined experience in fire sprinklers, including focused training on fire pumps. While most traditional fire sprinkler companies outsource inspection, testing and maintenance of fire pumps, the health of your sprinkler system extends to all its components, especially its water source. Keeping up with regular inspections and maintenance is critical to ensure that the entire system operates as intended during a fire. Freedom Fire LLC employs the best fire pump inspectors in the area to provide these services to our valued customers.\nOften with aging equipment, the fire pump is no longer performing as intended. Our technicians identify deficient components that may need to be replaced, install failures that may be impacting the fire pump\u2019s performance or system modifications that have impacted the requirements of the fire pump. Once these issues are identified, Freedom Fire LLC works with customers to find repair options that fit within their goals and budgets. If you have a fire pump that needs inspection services or has been tested by another vendor and needs a performance assessment, please contact Freedom Fire LLC.\n\nFire Pump Services\nWeekly and Monthly Churns, Quarterly Testing, Annual Flow Testing, Laser Alignments, Repacks, All Motor Services, Performance Assessments, Rehabs, Replacements and Installations\n\n## Service Area\nProudly serving commercial and residential customers from all of New Hampshire, Vermont, Maine and Massachusetts\nSchedule Service\n\n## To request a consultation for a free quote, please complete the form below.\nRecaptcha requires verification.\nreCAPTCHA\n-\nSend\n## Thank You!\nWe will be in touch soon.\n\n### [PAGE] https://www.freedomfirene.com/sprinklers\nFire Sprinklers\n# Expert Service and Maintenance of Sprinkler Systems\nFreedom Fire LLC is adept at all aspects of fire sprinkler systems including installation (both commercial and residential), system modifications, retrofits, repairs and 24-hour emergency service.\nFreedom Fire LLC offers extensive inspection, testing and maintenance programs.

Currently, I am the Pleasant hill School District #69 Superintended, and we recently completed a major sanitation repair in our district. PIPCO worked with us to complete the job in a very short time frame, and the exhibited the workmanship, dedication, and respect that one would expect fro, a high-level performance contractor. PIPCO consistently provided an abundance of information and updates to create a partnership that solved a very difficult and stressful repair.\n \n\nNot only has PIPCO worked with my school district personnel in completing our sanitation repair, they are also the first company I call when other various repairs need to be completed. their expansive company provides many departments that can help in unique situations.

We have the knowledge and staff to meet your needs.\n\nWhat are the inspection and maintenance requirements for FIRE EXTINGUISHERS? The National Fire Protection Association's \"NFPA 10,\" \"Standard for Portable Fire Extinguishers\" specifies minimum requirements that must be met for a fire extinguisher to be..\nFire Extinguishers Repairs & Services\n\nStart dowsing fires before the fire department arrives. Even if the fire department is just minutes from your business, a fire can spread with startling speed. An approved, well-maintained sprinkler system can help slow down a fire\u2019s progress until emergency personnel arrive.\nFire Sprinklers Inspection & Repairs\n\nWe are equipped to meet the rigorous requirements of most of today\u2019s complex fire alarm systems including systems originally installed by others. We test and inspect all system components, keeping them ready to respond at the required sensitivity level, while significantly reducing unwanted false alarms.\nFire Alarm Inspection & Testing\n\nFire pumps are often a forgotten element of an automatic fire protection system. If a fire pump does not work, the entire system may fail. Stringent inspection and testing requirements are intended to prevent a pump failure that could be catastrophic. Our expert installation, inspection and service capabilities include the tools and manpower.\nFire Pump Installation & Repairs\n\nWe provide conveniently scheduled back flow testing, repair and installation services to Western Washington. We pride ourselves on educating you, the water customer, on how to reduce the risk of inadvertently contaminating your private or public water supply.\nBackflow Repair Services\n\nWill your emergency lights work when you need them? What are the inspection and maintenance requirements for Emergency Lighting? Emergency lights provide lighting in corridors, stairwells, ramps, escalators, aisles, and exit passageways in the event of a power outage.\nEmergency Lighting Services\n\nHow does the alarm work? Your alarm system has a \"dialer\" incorporated into the main circuit board, that connects to your phone line and \"dials\" the central alarm monitoring station (central station) and communicates with the central station computers.\nAlarm Monitoring Services\n\nYou can\u2019t just throw water on a grease fire. You need to eliminate the fuel source and smother the flames in order to get a kitchen fire under control. Fire Solutions NW\u2019s kitchen fire suppression installation and service maintains your system so it acts as it is designed.\nKitchen Hood Suppression\n\nBy its very definition, visual surveillance is the ultimate security tool, allowing a real time and recorded view of business assets. Yet system viability is only as effective as the sum of its parts \u2014 hardware selection, location and placement, integration with complimentary systems, monitoring and management. It is this scenario where Fire Solutions NW leverages its core strengths.\nCCTV Surveillance Installation\n\nIn some cases, conventional fire suppression methods can cause as much or more damage than the fire itself. When specialized equipment and resources are simply too valuable or too fragile to trust to a standard sprinkler system, faster, more responsive fire suppression is needed. Fire Solutions NW installs and services Special Hazard Suppression systems designed to detect and suppress fires in seconds.\nSpecial Hazard Suppression\n\nFirst aid kits for the workplace All responsible employers know that first aid kits are never a luxury. Managers know that the primary asset of any business is its employees and their protection, and that they must be ready to respond in the event of an accident. Further, Federal Regulations under the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) require that emergency response resources be readily available in the workplace.\nFirst Aid Training\n\nFire Solutions NW will provide you with extremely accurate flow tests with our highly trained personnel and the latest equipment. Our equipment is calibrated regularly for precision to ensure accurate results. We perform our water flow tests with minimal interruption and will coordinate our schedule with the Water Authority if required. As always we will provide you with a comprehensive test report for your records.\nFire Hydrant Test Flow\n\nAs part of NFPA 25 the five-year test requires a number of inspection, test and maintenance steps, but we\u2019re focusing specifically on your work with our team on the testing of the standpipe itself. Dry Standpipes. An air test at 25 PSI is to be conducted prior to flowing the system with water. (NFPA 25 6.3). Pressure over 25 PSI is not recommended due to the the potential for damage should any components of the plumbing fail. (Wet systems do not require this, as any leaks are evident by the presence of water. Note that NFPA 25 does not have an established allowable leakage rate, rather, it is subject to the judgement and experience of the fire protection contractor to determine if leakage should halt further testing until repairs are made.\nStandpipe Hydrostatic Testing (5year)\nLoad more\n\n### [PAGE] https://www.firesolutionsnw.com/services/alarm-monitoring-services\n# Alarm Monitoring Services\nHow does the alarm work?\nYour alarm system has a \u201cdialer\u201d incorporated into the main circuit board, that connects to your phone line and \u201cdials\u201d the central alarm monitoring station (central station) and communicates with the central station computers. The alarm control sends signals to the central station computers which identify the specific location of the alarm system (or the protected premise), the nature of the alarm (burglary, fire, panic, duress...) and the location of the problem (front door, basement motion detector, attic smoke detector...).\nWhat happens at the central station?\nAfter the information has been received from the (alarm system), the central station computer brings up the information along with the appropriate police, fire and medical departments to the central station operator\u2019s dispatch terminal. The operator also has the instructions for how to handle each individual situation that can occur with the alarm system.\nCustomized responses could include notifying a guard company, paging the home owner, or only notifying the emergency call list and not the police.\nAlarm monitoring with today\u2019s burglar and fire alarm controls gives the central station a great amount of information if you contact Home Concierge concerning the status of the alarm. Customization of response through the central station operator allows the premise owner the greatest ability to control access and security for their property and loved ones.\nPleasecontact\na Fire Solutions NW Representative to get a free quote today!\n\n### [PAGE] https://www.firesolutionsnw.com/services/cctv-surveillance-installation\n# CCTV Surveillance Installation\nBy its very definition, visual surveillance is the ultimate security tool, allowing a real time and recorded view of business assets.

The inspector checks to make sure the light will burn for 90 minutes, the bulbs stay bright for the entire time, and that the light heads are pointed in the correct direction. \n#### Battery Replacement\nThe batteries in emergency lights have a limited lifespan. Depending on the type of battery used, they may need to be replaced every 3 to 5 years, or as recommended by the manufacturer. Regularly check the battery status and replace them when they reach the end of their useful life. It\u2019s important to note that these testing frequencies are general recommendations, and you should always refer to the specific guidelines provided by local regulations, building codes, and the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for your particular emergency lighting system. Additionally, it is advisable to keep a log or documentation of all maintenance and testing activities performed on emergency lights for compliance and reference purposes.\nSee More FAQs\n## We Care About Keeping the Mid-South Safe\nMid-South Safety Services\nAt Mid-South Safety Services, we believe you should have full confidence that your emergency lights and fire extinguishers will work in an emergency.

As your Fire and Security Integrator we have several new and exciting options to give you access to these mission critical systems. \nBelow we have included some of these great options, many of your existing systems may simply need an upgrade to accomplish this.\n### \n### Connected Life Safety Services (CLSS)\nWouldn\u2019t it be great to know if a detector is out of calibration, dirty or a CO detector is reading high levels instantly anywhere you have your smartphone? \nThe CLSS Gateway is Honeywell Fire\u2019s interface connecting to a Honeywell fire system panel or network, serving as a portal between the panel, the Cloud, and peripheral devices. Instant notification on your smartphone when an event occurs. Remote Silence and acknowledge when you are onsite (Bluetooth connection required). The CLSS gateway utilizes a Cellular or WiFi connection with the Honeywell Cloud and Central Station.\n\n### Brivo Cloud Based Access Control and Video\nLike a subscription to cable, you can get the security tools you need to manage your business with hardware that is easily installed by Great Lakes and a platform that is quickly up and running. Eliminate the need for old-fashioned keys and fobs that must be continuously purchased or replaced as your employee base changes. When you move to Brivo\u2019s cloud solution, you can remove, add and adjust access for anyone who has access to your facility using an online, centralized platform. You can also track who has access and when they are onsite to keep your facility and valuable business assets safe.\nThe cloud platform makes it simple to revoke or grant access through a mobile application. You can remotely set-up access schedules, create groups, view video and know who is accessing your facilities from wherever you are. What could be more convenient?\n### \n### Honeywell Total Connect\nArm or disarm your security system, unlock or lock doors, turn lights off or on, adjust thermostat temperature, even open or close Chamberlain garage doors from wherever you are. Receive alerts when events happen such as extreme temperature changes, water leaks, motion detection, or doors opening. Location awareness alerts you when you are out of boundaries, reminding you to set the alarm.\n\n### KNOX First Responder Access\nGreat Lakes Building Systems and Knox have partnered to provide our customers with the tools to assist our First Responders access to your facility in the time of need.

It serves as a means of egress for a quick and safe exit, helping to avoid injuries amid the chaos.\n\nEnsuring compliance with NFPA 101 regulations is essential, and our monthly and annual inspections are here to assist you. By entrusting us with your inspections, you can focus on your business operations while we help you take care of this critical aspect of your safety program.\n### Emergency Exit Light Inspections\nWith extreme weather events, emergencies or other unforeseen circumstances, you are bound to experience a power outage sooner or later.\nWhen that happens, having fully functioning exit signs and emergency lights is critical to the safety of those in the building.\nThompson Safety is a leading service provider for the testing, maintenance, repair, and replacement of exit and emergency lights to ensure that you are up to code and are providing a safe environment for your building occupants.\nAn Annual Exit / Emergency Lighting Inspection is required per NFPA 101, NFPA 70 and OSHA 29CFR1910. The experts at Thompson have the knowledge and know-how to handle all your exit sign and emergency lighting needs.\n### How The Service Works\nFacility Walkthrough:\nonsite assessment to determine the number/type/location of exit lights based on the square footage, specific hazards, exits and path of egress\nInspections:\nbased on the facility walkthrough we determine the appropriate service/maintenance program to continue or bring your equipment up to code.\nService Interval:\nestablish the appropriate service frequency, which will depend on the specific equipment being maintained and local requirements.\nDocumentation:\nprovide thorough documentation of all services performed, notations and deficiencies, in written or digital formats.\nInvoicing:\nmultiple payment and billing options for your convenience.\nOngoing Support:\n24/7 customer service and account access\n### Annual VS Monthly Inspections\nIn most jurisdictions, two types of inspections are required for all exit and emergency lighting. The first type is a monthly visual/push test, which serves the purpose of confirming the operational status and direction of the lights. Additionally, it helps to validate that, at the time of inspection, the battery will activate when the light loses power.\nThe second type is an annual inspection, often known as a \"90-minute test\" or a \"load test\" in certain jurisdictions. The primary objective of this inspection is to assess whether the backup battery can maintain lighting for the necessary duration (typically 90 minutes) during a power outage or emergency situation. Both inspections are mandated by NFPA 101; however, we recommend always consulting your local Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ) to understand acceptable testing and inspection methods.\n### Exit & Emergency Light Testing, Inspections, and Maintenance\nTo keep you code-compliant and safe, we follow a strict process. Here is what you can expect from our expert team:\nIf applicable, each battery is tested with a load tester to simulate a 90-minute function test on the battery.\nE-light charging units will be tested to confirm that the batteries are not being over (posing a fire hazard) or under charged.\nAll emergency light beams will be adjusted for proper egress lighting.\nA check verifying that the proper amount of power is reaching the emergency/light exit will be performed.\nAll exit signs and emergency lights will have a service label affixed to them indicating the month, year, and type of service performed.\nA complete and detailed e-light report will be provided to the customer for submittal to the insurance company and/or fire department \u2013 meeting OHSA documentation requirements.\n### Repairs and Replacement\nIf you are experiencing problems, or if testing reveals that your emergency lighting units aren\u2019t functioning properly, we can help! Our experienced crew has the tools and equipment to make the necessary repairs so that everything is up and running in no time.\nNeed to replace or upgrade your unit? We can handle that with top-of-the-line replacement exit signs and emergency lighting.\nDISCLAIMER\n: The content provided on this website is intended solely for informational purposes.
