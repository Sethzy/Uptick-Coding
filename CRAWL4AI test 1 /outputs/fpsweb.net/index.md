### The Story Behind The Brand
Fire Protection Specialists (FPS) was founded in 1991 with a mission to provide comprehensive fire safety solutions. Tom Anderson launched the company with a $2,500 loan and an ’82 Ford van, securing a partnership with Amerex to deliver essential services. By 1993, FPS hired its first employee and expanded its fleet, marking the start of a growing team.
​​
In 1994, FPS added hood cleaning services and established its first shop in Barre Mills, WI, alongside a Fire Suppression Systems Division. Continued growth led to the launch of a Fire Alarm Division in 2000 and a move to a larger 10,000-square-foot facility in Bangor, WI, in 2004. FPS expanded further in 2018 with a second location in Eau Claire, WI, and in 2024, acquired a neighboring building in Bangor to create a dedicated space for its Hood Cleaning Division and a state-of-the-art conference room, transforming the site into a complete operational hub.
​
Our skilled team of certified technicians and experienced project managers is committed to delivering tailored fire protection solutions with excellence and customer satisfaction.
