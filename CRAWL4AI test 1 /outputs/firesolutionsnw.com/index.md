Chris Bosson did a great job on my fire alarm system! None of the people I’ve had out have been able to resolve my issue but he did it in less than two hours. Very polite and great service. Will most definitely contact fire solutions when I need service again.

He was so helpful and answered all my questions he completed the job quickly and was very professional and courteous. Their prices are very fair and I will definitely use them going forward for all my fire safety needs.
