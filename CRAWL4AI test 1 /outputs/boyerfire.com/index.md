## West Overland Fire Marshal

Thank you and your people for the hard work you do to keep our businesses safe.
## The Joseph Center

Owen came out for our inspection and our basement was flooded. He was very professional and flexible with our situation. He went over and beyond and pumped out the water to complete the inspection. Thanks again we are greatly appreciative.
## Project Manager
![](https://boyerfire.com/)
Wanted to give a quick shout out for Josh and his team on site. Josh has continued to navigate a really tough Fire Marshal and an even more challenging inspector with the city. He’s managed to work efficiently with all the other trades around him to hit important Owner deadlines. That effort certainly doesn’t go unnoticed. The team appreciates guys like Josh on our jobsites for helping us run things smoothly and has truly become one of our most reliable teammates.
## Brendon

One of the best fire protection companies in the area. They are very thorough and do a great job at keeping the fire suppression system in good standing which also keeps the residents safe. Melvin, Owen, Grayson, and Chris are all great people that I have worked with, and they all do a VERY VERY good job at explaining things to you so you understand what they are doing and why. Thank you guys for all you do!
