Gotta have it feature, that I don't have now: More efficient invoicing, streamlined inspection scheduling with reminders/calendar integration, easier compliance reporting integration, project management, estimating capabilities. Product Blocker: Current small team size (3-4 people), but David plans to scale up to 3-4 technicians, which would make Uptick a good fit. Timeline to Purchase/Have they been looking?: David plans to scale up in 2-3 months, at which point he believes Uptick would be a good fit. He is open to the solution. What are they paying now? Have they received quotes from a similar tier of platform?: Not specified what they are currently paying or if they've received quotes from similar platforms. Uptick's pricing model is a minimum of $795/month for up to 5 users, with additional users costing $159/month.",Honeywell CLSS,,Installation,Fire & Security,QB online,,,,84550207013
