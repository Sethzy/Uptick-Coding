Call us today to discuss solutions to meet your needs.\nRequest Service\nRequest Estimate\nVortex Doors access control systems are a reliable, convenient, and cost-effective solution that protects your property without impeding your staff or business. Whether you need to secure a few doors within an office or a large, multi-building complex, our team can provide the hardware and software necessary to safeguard your building and assets.\nWith over 85 years of experience installing, repairing, and servicing commercial doors, Vortex creates customized access solutions. We specialize in traditional access control systems, IP-based systems, and cloud-based systems ‒ for stronger protection, flexibility and control.\n### Access Control System Types:\nBadge Readers\nBarrier Arms\nElectromagnetic Locks\nGate Access Control\nCommercial Electronic Door Lock System\nAccess Control Keypad\nWe partner with leaders in the industry to provide the best solution for you and your business.\n### Finding the Right Access Control System\nAs technology has evolved, new systems have emerged, offering businesses greater visibility and control over their buildings. However, many companies find traditional tools still provide the best solution at a lower cost, which is why Vortex offers a wide range of hardware, in order to find the system that best matches your needs. We can assist with:\nRemote Transmitters for Doors and Gates\nMagnetic Locks\nKeypad Controls\nProximity Readers\nCard Readers\nKey Fobs\nAutomatic Timed Locking\nTelephone Entry Systems\nGate Boxes and Loop Detectors\nAudio/Video Intercom Systems\nBiometrics\n\n### Traditional Access Control Systems\n\nKeypads are the simplest and most traditional access control system. Still widely used in retail, commercial, and industrial spaces, they require users to input a code to unlock the door. Though keypads can be installed as part of a complex, interconnected system, they are generally standalone units ‒ controlling access to a single door without the use of a key, fob, or access card.\nAdvanced engineering and design allows them to work with almost any entry point technology, such as magnetic locks, electric strikes, and automatic gates. Vortex offers a broad selection of keypad devices, including:\nStand Alone Keypads:\nStand alone units have a built in touchlock system that requires each user to type in an assigned Pin code. Additionally, to stand alone keypads, Vortex offers a unique addition to this type of system, utilizing new technology. Master Lock’s Bluetooth device can provide cell phone access to any existing stand-alone system with an audit trail.\nIntegrated Digital Keypads:\nOperate with unique codes assigned to users and linked to a centralized access control system that monitors and tracks movement in and out of your building.\nOutdoor Digital Keypads:\nWhether stand alone or integrated, outdoor keypads are durable and protected, capable of operating reliably for years in harsh weather.\nDormakaba Push Button Locks:\nNot reliant on batteries or electricity, these are mechanical, push button devices. A keyless solution that can be easily incorporated in order to control access to sensitive areas.\n### IP-Based Access Control Systems\n\nIP-based access systems operate via a LAN/WAN connection. They also let you grant electronic access to specific users utilizing a backend database. In addition, they are typically easy to expand upon, capable of building a network of more than 50 doors without the need for rewiring.\nThe majority of IP systems rely on key fobs or access cards, proximity devices that emit a low radio frequency, which communicates with the access control system to unlock and monitor entry/exit.\n### Advantages of IP-Based Access Control Systems:\n\nEasily Expandable\nInstalling an IP-based system allows you to quickly implement and expand your security, creating a grid that lets you control access through your current communication lines.\n\nEfficient Management\nEmbedded software lets you manage users and monitor their behavior in real-time with a web browser or PC.\n\nFlexible Scheduling\nIP-based systems incorporate multiple credential modes, offering you a variety of access options. You can utilize a card only system, a PIN only system, or a combination of the two.\n\nMultiple Credentials\nThese systems have multiple credential modes making it flexible for a variety of access options. You can utilize a card only system, a PIN only system, or a combination of the two.\n### Cloud-Based Access Systems\nCloud-based systems not only allow you to manage access to your building from a desktop or mobile device. They also allow users to unlock and activate doors with their smartphones, rather than rely on a keycard or fob. Introducing cloud-based software into your security system reduces your costs and operational burden, while also letting you manage your building remotely, which includes:\nAdding New Users\nExpanding Access\nRestricting Access\nRevoking Access\nLocking Down Your Property\nTracking User Behavior\nExporting Access Logs\nVerifying System Operation\n\nA strong choice for small, large, single, and multi-site facilities, cloud-based systems are easy to use and scale. For businesses that require different levels of access both between and within buildings, a cloud-based system provides a comprehensive view of all exit/entry activity, as well as a clear summary of the permissions granted to all employees. It provides you with total control over who enters your building and how events are tracked, accessible anytime from your smartphone.\nWhether a traditional, IP-based, or cloud-based access control system is the right solution, Vortex Doors can help. Contact our team today to schedule an appointment or give us a call so we can assess your needs. At Vortex, we pride ourselves on excellent service and providing the best solution for you and your business.\n### Turnkey Solutions\nNew Installations\nFirst-time installations of new efficient Cloud-based or IP-based Access Control Systems Integrated w/ All Types of Doors, Gates, Barriers Arms, Turn-styles and more.\nRepairs\nComprehensive Repair Services of Access Control Systems which have been Integrated with All Types of Doors, Gates, Barriers Arms, Turn-styles and more.\n\nUpgrades/Replacements\nUpgrade or Replacement of Access Control Systems as a Result of Proprietary / Outdated / Discontinued Systems &/or Out-of-Business Providers.\nTroubleshooting\nDiagnosis of Malfunctions and Operational Errors of Access Control Systems & which have been Integrated with All Types of Doors, Gates, Barriers Arms, Turn-styles and more.\n### Comparison Chart\n\n### Fully Certified & Accredited Commercial Door Experts\n\n### What Our Customers Are Saying\nExcellent\nMuey T.\nWith Danny Rupp's help, we were able to get our access doors operating.

Thanks from RobLive Fit Gym SF\nAlexis B.\nMeredith, Dani and the team at Vortex have been the MOST responsive contractor I have ever worked with! We switched to Vortex almost 2-years ago for a million dollar homes community that I manage in the tech center after several contractors that would 'fit us in when they could' and provided less than sub-par service. Vortex has always been responsive, professional, courteous and still takes my calls when they are just as frustrated with the access system as I am. I continually recommend Vortex to friends and colleagues alike for their superior service, prompt response, professionalism and amazing communication! Thank you Meredith, Dani and the entire Vortex team.\nKelly N.\nWe've had an ongoing problem with our main entrance doors and the ability to program them with our access control system.

Once repairs are made you can be sure that we will notify you of any problem areas or if your doors do not comply with current AAADM safety standards to help protect you and help avoid any potential injuries to your Customers.\n### Automatic Door Types:\nAutomatic Sliding Doors\nAutomatic Swinging Doors\nAutomatic Telescoping Doors\nLow Energy Door Operators\nADA Automatic Door Openers\n### Ensuring convenient, versatile, and touch-free entry for high-traffic areas.\nProperly maintained Automatic Doors optimize the flow of people, goods, and equipment through your building. When properly serviced, automatic door systems provide visitors with fast, easy, and reliable access to all critical entry points.\nWhether controlled through key cards, wall switches, or automatic door sensors, these door systems open and close quickly, quietly, and efficiently, to accommodate seniors, those with disabilities and those pushing shopping carts or have their hands full while simultaneously limiting exposure to external temperatures and preserving indoor climate zones.\nAAADM Certified Vortex technicians can custom fit automatic doors to almost any opening, making them a valuable addition to a wide range of environments and institutions.\nHospitals and Healthcare Facilities\nShopping Malls and Retail Centers\nSupermarkets\nOffice Buildings\nGyms\nUniversity Campuses\nStadiums\nConvention Centers\n\nOur technicians provide trouble-free inspection, maintenance and repairs, for exceptional performance tailored to your needs. We offer automatic door systems with a full assortment of options and frame widths.\n\nFull Glass Panels\n. Ideal for internal and secondary entryways, glass doors create clear, unobstructed views that maximize natural light.\nConcealed Sliding Doors\n. Tracks for concealed sliding doors extend back into the adjoining wall, allowing the glass panels to remain completely hidden when the door opens.\nTelescoping Doors\n. Designed for narrow entryways, telescopic doors save space in buildings with little room for paneling and hardware.\nAirtight Seals\n. Strong seals prevent airborne particles, such as dust and bacteria, from contaminating cleanrooms and laboratories.\nImpact Glass\n. Installing automatic sliding doors with reinforced glass creates fortified entry points without damaging curb appeal or aesthetics.\nWeather Resistant Frames and Paneling\n. Buildings in harsh climates, subject to storms, tornados, and hurricanes, may require thicker glass and heavy construction in order to withstand excessive rain, snow, and wind.\n### Automatic Doors for All Industries\nVortex provides repair, inspection and maintenance services for a variety of automatic doors across a wide range of commercial sectors, including:\n\nRetail\n\nHealthcare\n\nGrocery Stores\n\nBanks\n\nMalls\n\nAirports\n\nAuto Dealerships\n\nProperty Management\n\nClean Rooms\n\nHotels\n\nBiotech\n\nSenior Care\n\nFitness\n\nConvenience Stores\n\nGas Stations\n### Turnkey Solutions\nAnnual Safety Inspection\nAnnual Automatic Door safety inspections ensure compliance, increase safety readiness and prevent expensive fines.\nInspection Reporting\nComprehensive Automatic Door inspection reports provide a detailed summary of noncompliant doors and enable proactive management to address gaps.\nInspector Certification\nVortex field techs are trained and certified to thoroughly inspect Automatic Doors, ensuring your doors are in compliance.\n\nNon-Compliance Repair\nVortex can immediately repair Automatic Doors thatinspections show are not compliant . . . saving customers time and money.\nReplacement\nReplace damaged and non-compliant Automatic Doors and components to get your operations back into operating mode.\nInnovative Solutions\nEliminate the need and cost associated with expensive replacement work, leveraging Vortex innovative solutions.\n### Service and Set-up\nInspection, maintenance and repairs are crucial to an automatic door’s performance, integrity, and long-term costs. Vortex service teams are AAADM Certified (American Automatic Association of Door Manufacturers), trained not only to troubleshoot performance problems, but also ensure your doors conform to state and local safety standards.\nBrands repaired and upgraded include Besam, Dorma and Horton, though our experience within the industry qualifies us to work on doors from practically every manufacturer. Our fast response, proactive methodology, and deep, technical knowledge minimizes downtime, protects your assets, and extends the life of valuable hardware. Vortex technicians are taught to identify and correct problems in every part of your door systems before they lead to damage, liability, or mechanical failure, including:\nFaulty Safety Devices\n. To protect users, all automatic doors are equipped with safety sensors that prevent them from closing until the entrance is clear of people. All safety devices must be tested regularly by a qualified professional to ensure they meet the standards laid down by the AAADM.\nProgramming Errors\n. If a door’s command settings do not follow the proper sequence, it may cause the panels to open too slow or close too fast, leading to access and safety issues.\nSensor Malfunction\n. When a microwave or infrared sensor can no longer detect motion or becomes overly sensitive to approaching objects, it can seriously compromise access and safety.\nMisaligned Tracks\n. When a door’s tracks and frame are no longer in line, the door may become jammed in place or create gaps between panels.\nPower Failure\n. Bad wiring and faulty connections can cause disruptions that freeze the door in place or leave it sitting wide open.\nWorn Weatherstripping\n. Rubber and plastic seals prevent energy loss, while also blocking out dust, debris, and pests.\nInsufficient Lubrication\n. To prevent wear, moving parts need to be oiled according to their manufacturer’s specifications.\n\nVortex service installs automatic doors as part of new construction or retrofits them onto existing buildings. We keep your systems up-to-date and running smoothly, ensuring entrances remain safe, accessible, and up to code.Contact us\ntoday for more information about setting up and servicing automatic doors in your building.\n### Types of Service Repairs\n#### Sliding\n\n#### Swinging\n\n#### Bifold\n\n#### Telescopic\n\nAAADM Inspection\nSensor Upgrades / Replacement\nHigh Traffic Control\nMotor Replacement\nBreakout Switches\nRoller Replacement\nDC1 retrofit\nRetrofit Speed Adjustment\nGlass Replacement\nWeather Seal Replacement\nElectrical Troubleshooting\nDrivebelt Replacement\nAccess Control Sys Integration\nAnnual Inspection to Reduce Liability\nInspector Certification\n### Fully Certified & Accredited Commercial Door Experts\n\n### What Our Customers Are Saying\nExcellent\nAlex\nVortex Doors services many of our Theatre doors including our automatic entrance doors. They really came through for us when our entry door wouldn't open for the day. Fast Service!!\nAri W.\nWe reached out to Vortex to help us make the front door at our business quieter. John came out the day after I called and provided so much helpful information about making adjustments to several of the noisy doors, including suggesting an automatic closer for the front door. He was knowledgeable, extremely courteous and truly demonstrated a desire to be of service. The following day, Jordan came and installed the closer and our front door has been magically silent ever since! Jordan even noticed that the seal around the door was missing so he sealed it for us and didn't even charge extra. I am so impressed by the technical prowess and helpful demeanor of both John and Jordan. Amy in the office was very helpful too, acknowledging my concerns and accommodating us so quickly. I highly recommend Vortex Doors!\nZachary C.\nVortex has been fantastic at helping our company with our automatic, garage and keypad entry doors. They have come with creative solutions to our issues and resolved each one.\nNatalie D.\nAustin and Javier went above and beyond to ensure our doors were installed wonderfully. We needed an extension chord placed and they even wrapped it neatly in the corner where it isn't noticed.

We will for sure use you again.\nP R\nWe received the greatest service from David Hibbert & Robert Lawrence today.

We get professional and kept their work area clean and organized.\n\n### Perfect service, incredibly fast.\nPlease call us at\nContact Us\n\n### [PAGE] https://www.vortexdoors.com/commercial-doors-services/security-gates-grilles\n# Commercial and Industrial Gates\nGate Types\nContact Us\n\n## Security gates and grills provide a strong barrier that discourages intruders at businesses, parking structures, and industrial facilities ‒ a visible and functional deterrent against unauthorized access that can be configured for simplicity, functionality, and style.\nRequest Service\nRequest Estimate\n\nBut while gates and grilles provide safety and peace of mind, they’re also susceptible to a number of mechanical issues that could undermine their reliability. Friction, debris, impact, corrosion, and severe weather can weaken structural integrity, making them brittle, unreliable, and difficult to operate. Regular maintenance helps you find and resolve problems before they compromise performance.\n### Commercial Gate Types:\nCounter Shutters\nSide Coiling Security Gates\nRolling Aluminum Gates\nSecurity Gates for Business & Storefronts\nParking Lot Gates\nSwinging Gates\nMan Trap Systems\nVortex service teams work proactively ‒ testing, fixing, and replacing parts that no longer meet accepted standards. Equipped with the latest tools and knowledge, our technicians restore gates and grilles with minimal downtime, helping you avoid major, costly repairs. Extensive training and experience makes us the first choice for preventative maintenance, which reduces the chance of unexpected failure stemming from:\nRust\n. Corroded gates and grills are liable to break under heavy and repeated impact, making them unstable and unreliable. While we can scrub away minor rust deposits, for major corrosion, we prefer to replace the affected component with one made from moisture-resistant material.\nMisalignment\n. Ground shifts, improper installation, and frequent use can force tracks out of alignment, preventing them from opening and closing smoothly. Our technicians can adjust displaced tracks and mounting brackets, re-securing loose parts to ensure the assembly remains level and balanced.\nWear and Tear\n. Because gates and grilles operate under significant weight, their wheels, rollers, tracks, and hinges have to be inspected regularly for chips, dents, or degradation that might indicate they’re no longer strong enough to withstand collisions or heavy movement. Vortex teams can source replacement parts from any manufacturer. We can even refurbish custom or hard-to-find parts to manufacturer standards.\nPower Disruptions\n. Wiring can become worn, frayed, or rusted, making it impossible for motors and sensors to operate as intended. Our technicians can also identify power issues that might prevent gates and grills from responding to commands.\nMotor Issues\n. We lubricate gears, chains, and other moving parts in order to ensure gates and grills open and close smoothly. At the same time, we clean out any dirt, grime, or buildup that might impede the motor.\nVortex service teams keep security gates and grilles in prime condition. Consistent maintenance protects your staff, property, and investment. By catching problems early, our technicians not only avert costly breakdowns. They extend the lifespan of your gate or grill, allowing you to secure your business at low cost, without disrupting daily operations.Contact us today\nto learn how our repair, inspection, and maintenance programs help promote workplace safety while saving you time, money, and stress.\n### Fully Certified & Accredited Commercial Door Experts\n\n### What Our Customers Are Saying\nExcellent\nTrevor A.\nOur business has a loading dock with a roll up bay door. The bay door was bent off the tracks, and we found it couldn't be closed or moved up or down. Our initial call had a response time of about 30 minutes. They showed up, diagnosed the issue, and provided a fix time of 4-6 weeks.Of course we weren't delighted, but we wanted to move forward. They understood that having a bay door that didn't close was a major issue for us and they immediately began to troubleshoot, finding a solution for us. Early that next morning we had Daniel show up and said he can get us operational (door being able to open, close, and secured) within 3 hours. They finished in 2. Daniel, Phillip, and Conner made the the security of our building at Pacific Office Automation a priority for us again, and it was all done in less than 24 hours. I have nothing but good things to say about this experience.Response time was A+, problem solving was A+, and we will be using them in the future for any and all of our needs. I guess we can close the door on this one.\nJonnii B.\nHenry and Greg did a great job here at our facility , they both made our door work like new all while following our security protocols.\nKenny R.\nWe just had a vertical security bar installed between our front doors yesterday. I was a little nervous about how the device would impact function until Jason spent some time making little adjustments at my request including swing speed, closing sound level, etc. I'm actually very happy with the job he and the team did. Thanks!\nLa Bella Vita Health & W.\nHad our door fixed in Aug. and had to call them back out in Oct. for a few tweaks (door was squeaking and rubbing at bit when it was warm so door wouldn't fully close).

A faulty or inoperable hangar door could result in decreased security for your aircraft and other items kept inside the hangar.\nSince hangar doors are often very large, it’s important that all of the seals are maintained and in good condition to avoid dust and debris from coming into the hangar to ensure a clean environment for the aircraft and equipment.\n### Hangar & Large Scale Door Types:\nHorizontal Sliding Doors\nBi-Folding Doors\nOperable Partitions\nKeeping People Safe\nIn order to keep you, your employees and customers safe, it is imperative to ensure your hangar doors are regularly maintained and repaired. A faulty hangar door could result in damage to the aircraft and security issues.\nImproper installation or maintenance of your hangar doors can result in damage to the doors themselves, or damage to the property within or around the hangar.\n\n### Hangar Door Inspection\n\nRegular inspections are necessary to provide peace of mind and confidence that you are creating a safe working environment. Semi-annual or annual inspections allow technicians to clean and lubricate mechanical components, protect against rust, and extend the life of critical operational mechanisms.\nOur technicians examine every element of the door system, such as the panels, rollers, cables, straps, safety devices, motor operators, and weather seals. In the event of an emergency, our technicians are on call to diagnose and repair problems to get your hangar door working safely again so you can operate your business.\n### Turnkey Solutions\nInspection\nAnnual inspections lower the lifetime cost of ownership and can extend the lifespan of the door system.\nPreventative Maintenance\nProactively check and service critical parts before they break and result in significant downtime.\nRetrofit Automation\nRetrofit automation to improve ergonomics and optimize the operation of hangar doors.\n\nRefurbishment\nSalvage custom or hard to find parts to manufacturer standards.\nRepair\nRepair worn and damaged parts to get your door back into operating mode.\nParts Replacement\nUpgrade or replace custom or hard to find parts to manufacturer standards.\n### Maintenance and Repair\nWhile general wear and tear over time is inevitable, regular maintenance can help prevent costly emergency repairs. Our technicians are trained on all aspects of hangar door systems, including tracks, rollers, safety devices, locks, and electrical components.\n\nMaintenance includes inspecting all aspects of the hangar doors. This means ensuring that all weather-stripping and seals are in good condition to make sure that dust, dirt and debris do not enter your hangar.\nPreventative maintenance helps in catching repairs early, so you can make certain your assets and property remain protected. We help ensure your doors are safe, secure, and that all parts are tested and calibrated for easy operation to keep you flying with confidence!\n### Upgrades, Refurbishments, and Customization\nReplacing a door can at times be more effective than repairing it. Our technicians offer solutions on the best options to help save you time and money.\nA variety of factors may qualify your hangar doors for repair including weather and regular wear and tear. We can help determine which parts can be salvaged and which should be replaced in order to improve safety and reliability.

We shopped around and called a number of door companies with minimal, or should I say, less than enthusiastic efforts to gain our trust and business. Our stores structure was built in the 1950's so there were many company representatives who came to check it out and never got back to us or there quote was out of this world because of the possibility of many unforeseen issues, to say the least. Once we called VORTEX I could tell we finally had the ball rolling in the right direction. There were a number of folks involved from the beginning; the local Mgr. Randy McFarland, Scott McGauvren, to the installers including Cotton and Josh as well as a few others who's names I've forgotten. Most importantly it was a great overall effort by everyone involved ! Although not everything went as planned due to the age of the building and the unexpected obstacles, everything went as smoothly as anyone could expect. Even though they had to return after the initial installation, it was all handled in an organized and professional manner. Thanks to Mr. McFarland and his San Antonio, VORTEX group we have an awesome retail storefront door. JS\nTrent G.\nI am a commercial property manager.

Though compact, their interlocking slats provide reliable protection against forced entry, harsh weather, and heavy use.\nRequest Service\nRequest Estimate\n\nIn addition to their rugged construction, rolling steel doors also depend on regular maintenance to ensure safety, longevity, and smooth operation.

The office called and notified us they would arrive at 8:30AM and they did. They worked well together and were able to get all the end clips fixed that needed to be replaced and helped me grease up the old curtain door. $858 repair to maintain this old curtain style roll up door was awesome. The previous clips had ben banged up by years of abuse and fixed by me and my gate repair tool (just a hammer) for the past 2 years.It started off with the sales guy who came to look and he was very honest and quoted us $858 and said they could fix the issue of the sliding from the curtain style gate. I think replacement would be in the $5k range which I think we would have held off on.The office was very responsive as I dealt with Tiffany and Martha for scheduling and paperwork.\nJerry M.\nRyan from Vortex did an amazing job getting the roll up door operational and was very professional\nCardea\nAnthony and Orlando where great technicians to work with, professional fast and on time with roll up door installation\nChandler Y.\nAndrew is a professional and wonderful guy!

Our software system keeps track of when inspections are due, so you never have to worry about being delinquent on required inspections.\n### Fire Systems offers 24 hour emergency service and 24/7 monitoring for your fire alarm system. We also provide training in the proper use and maintenance of your system so everyone will be prepared to respond appropriately in an emergency situation. When you call Fire Systems, Inc we put you in contact with an individual specifically trained to address your fire protection needs.\n\n## FIRE ALARM MONITORING\n### The National Fire Code likely requires your building alarm system to be monitored 24/7. If a fire should occur after hours, this early warning could prevent extensive damage by notifying emergency responders and your designated contact of an emergency situation.\n### By having Fire Systems in the communication loop, we will also be notified of any reported alarms or trouble indications on your fire alarm system which hastens our response time. Using Fire Systems, Inc. to monitor and inspect your systems creates a seamless transition in communication. Our monitoring rates are very competitive, and migration is quick and easy.\n\n## FIRE ALARM SYSTEM INSTALLATION, RETROFITS & TENANT BUILD-OUTS\n### We have performed thousands of fire alarm installations, retrofits, and tenant build-outs on all types of facilities from enormous industrial warehouses and high rise buildings to small office or retail buildings. We have years of experience with tenant-build out projects and large-scale fire alarm system retrofits. If your facility is growing or being renovated, your fire alarm system will have to be adjusted accordingly in order to maintain code compliance. Our team is trained to identify the code requirements that your systems must adhere to.\n\n## DOES YOUR FACILITY ALSO HAVE A SPRINKLER SYSTEM?\n### If so, your sprinkler system is most likely connected to your fire alarm panel in order to detect when the sprinkler system is activated.
