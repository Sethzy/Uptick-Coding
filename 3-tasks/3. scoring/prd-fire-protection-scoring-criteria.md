## Usage Notes

This scoring system is designed to identify and prioritize fire protection companies that:

1. Are legitimate fire protection service providers
2. Focus primarily on fire protection (not diversified across many verticals)
3. Offer maintenance/inspection services (higher value than installation-only)
4. Are medium-sized companies (optimal size for target market)

The scoring criteria help filter and rank companies from Google Maps scraping results for business development and partnership opportunities.
